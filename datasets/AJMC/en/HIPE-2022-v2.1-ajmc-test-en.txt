1508 . παθὸν OL . παθὼν A .
In all the cases given above , except one or two which are specified , O has preserved the correct reading , and almost invariably sides with L against A .
A few of O ' s minor corrections of A are omitted ; 6 , δ . in accent as 495 . τῶνδέ τοι : 628 , μεθεῖσά μοι , where A omits the acute accent : 779 . δε O . δεῖν᾽ A : 890 . μώραν O . μωρὰν Α : 1433 . Bare O . Bite A : 149% . πᾶσ᾽ O . πάσ ' A .
These illustrate the minute accuracy of O .
3 - From this list of readings it is plain that O is a more correct MS . than A , and a fairer representative of the family of MSS . to which A belongs .
The list of differences just given , in almost all of which O corrects A ’ s errors , clearly shows A ’ s tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to A ’ s family , but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of O ’ s original .
The many places where the text of A omits a word or is corrupt , but where O supplies the omission and confirms L and the correct text , show that O certainly represents the text of an earlier date than A , when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which A has gathered .
4 . Certain corruptions are common to both O and A , and must have crept into the text of this family of the MSS . at a date considerably anterior to that of A .
The following is a list of all the errors common to O and A , which can be properly called errors of A ’ s famiiy® .
A very few minor divergencies of accent and orthography are omitted .

Ajax could not be himself ( φρενήρηθ ) and do this thing .
The gods must have destroyed his senses ( φρένας ὦλεσαν ) .

Cp . the metaph . uses of σκαιός , and Plat . Soph . 264 E , where πορεύεσθαι κατὰ τοὐπὶ δεξιὰ ἀεὶ μέρος is ‘to make the right selection in each case . ’
185 . ἐν ποίμναις πίτνων ] ‘As to assault the flocks ’
The participle is slightly proleptic ( as with πειρᾶσθαι ) .
Cp . Ant . 752 , ἢ κἀπαπειλῶν ὧδ᾽ ἐπεξέρχει θρασύς .
186 . ἧκον γὰρ ἂν θεία νόσοΞ ] ‘An affliction from the gods , indeed , may have come . ”
For this use of ἄν with the optative , cp . Aesch . Pers . Joh , ἀνθρώπεια δ᾽ ἄν τοι πήματ᾽ ἂν τύχοι βροτοῖς : Ag . 1507 , πατρόθεν δὲ συλλήπτωρ γένοιτ᾽ ἂν ἀλάστωρ .
These words develop the suggestion conveyed in φρενόθεν γε , to which they are attached with γάρ . Ajax cannot have done this ; at least not of his own impulse .
It may le , indeed , that a divine visitation is upon him .
This possibility is a farther reason for rejecting the notion that Ajax is really uilty .
ἀλλά ) ( 1 ) ‘It may have come , but Zeus grant that the report may be untrue! ”
Zeus and Phoebus , as the deities of divination , are implored to grant that the truth may be less terrible than it is according to the report set in motion by the Argives .
Or ( 2 ) ‘It may have come , but even then let not the evil be increased with false rumours spread by Argives .

The standing reproach against Odysseus , that he was the son of Sisyphus , although not acknowledged as trueby Sophocles ( seel . 1 ) , is represented as being used against him by his enemies .

The Chorus are uncertain of Ajax ’ whereabouts, as Odysseus was , supr . 33 . μακραίωνι implies that some time had passed since the judgment of the arms and Ajax ’ sullen withdrawal from the fight : cp . infr . 929 foll ἀγωνίῳ is a difficult word .
The inactivity of Ajax was his manner of contending with the chiefs : if the rumour was true , it was an inactivity in which he had been fatally active ; and however his leisure was employed, it was becoming full of danger to him ,
The force of ἀγών , in the sense of a dangerous contest , is therefore suited to the place , and the expression is an oxymoron , ‘ a perilous quarrelsome rest ’ ( for which , cp . Shak . Ant . and Cleo . 1 . 3 , < ’ Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart . )
( 2 ) Others suppose the words merely to mean ‘rest from combat , ’ i . e . from the general combat with the Trojans .

The image of a fire is continued in the following lines .
197 - 200 . The arrangement of these lines is difficult .
The elision of the last syllable of ὁρμᾶται and the hiatus after ἀτάρβητα and βαρυάλγητα are doubtful points .
It can hardly be questioned that the a of εὐανέμοις ( for εὐηνέμοιΞ ) is long .
καχαζόντων is rightly restored for xayχα(ζόντων. Brambach , ( Sophokl . Gesinge) suggesting εὐᾶνέμοις , gives the following scheme —
ἐχθρῶν δ᾽ ὕβρις ὧδ᾽ ἀτάρβητα ὁρμᾶτ᾽ ἐν εὐανέμοις βάσσαις πάντων καγχαζόντων γλώσσais βαρυάλγητ᾽ , ἐμοὶ δ᾽ ἄχος ἕστακεν .
But the difficulties are not tiius removed . Perhaps we may venture —

As applied to a harbour , εὐήνεμος is * sheltered from rough winds ’ but the image here is rather that of a forest glade , where , when a little fire is kindled , the wind that is not strong enough to extinguish it only fans it to strength .

201 foll . The exposition of the situation in the Ajax , like the ἀναγνώρισι5 in the Oed . Tyr . is effected through the meeting of those who on either side know only half the truth .
Tecmessa , whose affection for Ajax exceeds that of his own people , comes forth to meet the chorus of mariners before the hut .
They learn from her the truth of the calamity .
She learns from them the extent of it .
Schol . διδάσκει τὸν χόρον ὅτι Alas ἐστὶν ὁ σφάξας τὰ ποίμνια . πυνθάνεται δὲ παρὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ὅτι Ἑλληνικὰ ἦν τὰ σφαγέντα . ἑκάτερος οὖν παρ᾽ ἕκατέρου τὸ ἀγνοούμενον μανθάνει .

Various compounds of ὠμός are used to indicate the fierce impetuosity of Ajax , that cannot be reduced to rule : infr . 88 , τὸν ὠμόθυμον : 931 , ὠμόφρων : 548 , ἀλλ᾽ αὐτίκ᾽ ὡμοῖς αὐτὸν ἐν νόμοις πατρὸς | δεῖ πωλοδάμνειν κἀξομοιοῦσθαι φύσιν .

The darkened mind of Ajax is compared either to the troubling of waters by a flood , or to atmospheric disturbance , — as we speak of <dirty weather ”

This is Triclinius ’ explanation of τῆς dueplas , sc . καταστάσεως ,
As in the case of other feminine words

Lobeck prefers ὥρας .
Ajax ’ condition on the previous day was lamentable enough : what new trouble has arisen during the night ?
210 . Τελεύταντος ] The first syllable is to be scanned as long : cp . Ἱππὸ pédav , Παρθενοπαῖος in Jambic verse .
Others read Φρυγίοιο for Φρυγίου , which is questionable both as to the form of the genitive and the division of the line .

 the epic style , but possibly with some variation of meaning .
Goodly , ” which is the meaning of κλυτός in such expressions as κλυτὰ μῆλα ( Od . 9 . 308 ) , is not sufficiently pointed here , and the Scholiast may be right in saying κλυτὰ λέγει τὰ αἰπόλια διὰ τὰς ἐν αὐτοῖς Tapaxas καὶ φωνάς .

376 . “ 1 rained forth dark - flowing blood . ”
ἐρεμνόν is another Homeric epithet , not merely signifying ‘dark ’ ( and so recalling μέλαν αἷμα ) , but * darkling , ’ with reference to the gloom of night and other circumstances of horror which surrounded the act .
377 . ὅπως οὐχ ὧδ᾽ ἔχειν ] ὅπως is here simply an indefinite ὧς , and is construed with the infinitive as &s might have been .
379 foll . The former outburst was towards the Atreidae .

So the Scholiast seems to understand the words . κακοπινέστατον , ‘defiled , ’ i . e . by continual base practices .
Musgrave suggested an allusion to the act of disguising himself as a wandering beggar mentioned in Od . 4 . 242 foll . , but preferred to derive ἄλημα ( = mawrdAn ) from ἀλέω .
The earlier explanation is here preferable to both these , and in infr . 390 , ἄλημα may quite well mean , ‘cause of error ’ ( τῶν Ἑλλήνων , gl . Pall ) .
Cp . the causative use of dAn in Aesch . Ag . 193 , δύσορμοι | βροτῶν dar .
The error of which Ajax most complains is the misjudgment about the arms of Achilles .
382 . dyes ] ‘Dost prolong . ’
383 . ξὺν τῷ θεῷ ] The article is not added to θεός elsewhere in Sophocles without special reason , and the conjecture of Schndw . ξύν τοι θεῷ supplies a particle of connexion .
But the asyndeton 15 rather impressive , and τῷ θεῷ may be explained ‘ the god who gives the laughter or the tears ’
‘Laughter and sorrow are in the hands of God ; ’ i . e . we must be patient and the position may be reversed. The chorus reflect that the Divine power which now favours Odysseus and oppresses Ajax may hereafter work the opposite effect .
Cp . Trach . 131 foll . ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ πῆμα καὶ χαρὰ | πᾶσι κυκλοῦσιν , οἷον | ἄρκτον στροφάδες κέλευθοι .
384 . The syllable which has been probably lost from this line has been variously restored , μέν , νῦν , μήν , etc . having been supplied .
The Triclinian reading is harmless , and is followed in the text , in the absence of better MS . authority .
Ajax prays to see his enemy , that , even ruined as he is , he may avenge himself .
Cp . infr . 388 - 91 , Trach . 1107 foll . ἀλλ᾽ εὖ γέ τοι τόδ᾽ ἴστε , κἂν τὸ μηδὲν ὦ , | κἂν μηδὲν ἕρπω , τήν γε δράσασαν τάδε | χειρώσομαι κἀκ τῶνδε" προσμόλοι μόνον , kr A .
This is more probable than an aposiopesis of ὀδυρόμενον
 but that the honour of Ajax and his race is in question .

553 . That you have no perception of this misery . ’
554 . This line , although quite possibly Sophoclean , has the appearance of a marginal quotation rather than of an integral portion of the text of this passage .
It is probably from some lost play , and should be placed amongst the fragments of Greek tragic poetry .
556 , 7 . δεῖ σ᾽ ὅπως . . Belfas ] ‘You must find some way of showing . ”

The absence of the demonstrative ending ( τοιόνδε or τοιοῦτον ) may arise from the fact that Teucer is absent , and that Ajax is speaking of the future .
ἀμφί σοι ] “ Τὸ protect thee! ἀμφί as in ἀμφιβαίνειν , etc .
563 . τροφῆς dokvov ] ‘Unfaltering in care for thee . ” τροφῆς is gen . of respect . Essay on L . § 9 . p . 13 , 3 .
ἔμπα kel ] ἔμπα does not occur elsewhere in Attic Greek . Cp . Pind . N . 4 . 58 , ἔμπα , καί περ ἔχει , κιτιλ ,
 δρᾶν , ποιεῖν , etc . ( cp . 1324 ) .
— εἴργασται , instead of repeating ἔχει περάνας : cp . O . T . 54 ὡς εἴπερ ἄρξεις τῆσδε γῆς , ὥσπερ κρατεῖς ( n . ) .
28 τρανές , ‘clear , ’ like the cognate τορόν ( rt . τερ , τρα , τε - τραίνω , to pierce ) .
The adj . τρανής is not elsewhere extant . but τρανῶς is used by Aesch . ( Ag . 1371 ) and Eur . ( El . 758 ) .
The form τρανός was current in later Greek ; the earliest instance seems to be Dionys . Halic . ( c . 25 B . C . )
De Comp . Verborum c . 22 τρανὴν καὶ καθαρὰν δύναμιν . ἀλώμεθα : this fig . sense , with ref . to uncertainty ‘to be at sea , ’ as we say ) , belongs nowhere else to this verb , but often to πλανᾶσθαι ( Her . 6 . 37 , etc . ; Plat . Hipp . Ma . 304 C πλανὦμοι μὲν καὶ ἀπορῷ ἀεί ) .
24 θελοντής . The form ἐθελοντής occurs in Herodotus , Thucydides , Xenophon, and the Orators , as ἐθελοντήρ does in Od . 2 . 292 .
On the other hand θελοντής is cited only from Porphyrius ( c . 270 A . D . , see Lobeck , Phrym . 7 ) and Hierocles ( c . 450 A . D . ) , ἄρ . Slob . For . 75 . 14 ( p . 449 . 20 ) .
Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by Plato ( Crat . 406 A ) , while the earliest authority for θελήμων is Apoll . Rhod . 2 . 557 .
In ragio iambics θέλω was naturally preferred , on metrical grounds , to ἐθέλω , though the latter occurs n tragic anapaests ( as O . T . 1303 , Ph . 145 ) .
If θελοντής were found in a pasage where metre reguiredit , the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection .
But where , as here , aphaeresis was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote ἐθελοντής . — ὑπεῖύγην , as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself : cp . P . 1025 κλοπῇ τε κἀνάγκη ξυγείς ( n . )
Aesch . P . P . 108 ἀνάγκαις ταῖσδ ’ ὑπέζευγμαι .
26 t . κατηναρισμένας : for ἐναρίζω ‘to slay ’ ( properly with the further notion of ‘despoiling ’ ) cp . O . C . 1733 , Tr . 94 .
From the cognate form κατεναίρομαι we have κατήναρὲς in Anmi . 871 . - ἐς χερὸς , by a human hand .
The military sense , ‘at close quarters ’ ( Ten . H . 7 . 2 . 14 ἐνέβαλὸν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἐμάχοντο ) , is less fitting here .
- αὐτοῖς ποιμνίον ἐπιστάταις ; cp . fr . 873 αὐτοῖσιν ὅπλοις .
The idiom occurs in the Iliad ( as 8 . 24 ) , — sometimes with συν added ( as 14 . 498 ) , a form of it found also , though not often , in later poetry ( Eur . Ion 32 αὐτ ’ ξὺν ἄγγει ) . — ἐπιστάταῖς, ‘overseers , ’ masters ’ or ‘guardians ’ of them ; as a warrior is ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης ( Aesch . Prs . 379 ) , and a rower , ἐρετμῶν ( Eur . Helen . 1267 ) .
Cp . Eur . fr . 188 . 4 σκάπτων , ἀρῶν γῆν , ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν. 28 πᾶς τις . The deed was found out at dawn .
Common rumour at once pointed to Ajax .
Then the ὀπτήρ ( 29 ) informed Odysseus , who reached the tent of Ajax very soon after the tatters return ; as is shown by 296 - 304 compared with
νέμει : cp . Galea 7 . 582 ( Κuhn ) οὐκ ἴσην ἅπασι νέμει τὴν αἰτίαν . The corrupi τρέπει may have come from the glos on ἐκείνῳ . . νέμει which occurs in some of the later MSS . , εἰς αὐτὸν τρέπει .
This is one of the few instances ( like Ant . 386 and 831 ) where a true reading , lost in L , has been preserved in other MSs . Cp . crit . notes on 44 , 61 .
29 τς placed before its noun : 1163 : Ph . 519 . — ἐπτὴρ , a scout ; cp . Of . 14 .
 44 καὶ : cp . 38 n . - ὡς ἐπ ’ Ἀργεέοις: ὡς here marks the intention of Ajax ( which was frustrated ) : cp . Ph . 58 πλεῖς δ ’ ὡς πρὸς οἶκον ( n . ) .
46 κἂν ἐξεπράξατ ’ : schol . μὴ λέγε βούλευμα , φησίν· οὐ γὰρ ἦν βούλευμα ἀλλὰ πρᾶγμα , εἰ κατημέλησα ἐγώ .
Cp . Ph . 555 κοὺ μόνον βουλεύματα , | ἀλλ ’ ἔργα δρώμεν ’ .
The answer is more forcible than if the poet had written κἂν ἐξέπραξέ T : see on Ph . 105 , 985 , El . 408 . - The midd . ἐκπράσσομαι is rare ; in Her . 7 . 158 it means to avenge ’ ( φόνον ) . Cp . Q . T . 287 ἐπραξάμην ( n . ) .
46 ποίαισι κ . τ . λ . The datives denote manner ( or attendant circumstance ) , and refer to τὸ βούλευμ ’ . ἦν in 44 .
‘What were these daring schemes , what was this ras ) confidence , with which he planned the attack ? ’
- i . e . , How could he possibly have conceived such a mad enterprise ? ’
For ταῖσδε combined with ποίαισι , cp . Ph . 1204 ποῖον ἐρεῖς τόδ ’ ἔπος ;
47 νύκτρ κ . τ . λ . : an answer to the last question : - he relied on darkness , and on craft ; and none shared his secret .
48 ᾖ κα ) ; 38 n . — παρέστη , came close to us ; cp . Tr . 748 ποῦ δ ’ ἐμπελάζεις τἀνδρὶ καὶ παρίστασαι ; El . 295 βοᾷ παραστᾶσ’. 49 καὶ δὴ , ‘already ’ : O . C . 31 n . - δισσαῖς . . στρατηγίσιν πύλαις , the tentdoors of the two chiefs , Agamemnon and Menelais .
( Cp . Pans . 4 . 19 . 2 τὴν σκηνὴν τὴν στρατηγίδα . )
The phrase is equivalent , of course , to δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις .
721 στρατήγιον , n .
But , since there were two tents and two entrances , δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i . e . , the literal sense is , ‘two doors of chiefs . ”
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent , so that only one entrance could be meant by πύλαις , then , indeed , δισσαῖς could be explained only as reforring to the subst . implied in στρατηγίσιν, “ the tent - door of two chiefs , ’ = δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις .
But such a use of δισσαῖς seems impossible .
Could δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα ( e . g . ) mean , ‘a chariot belonging to two brothers ’ ?

The word μαιμῶσαν is Homeric : Il . 13 . 77 περὶ δούρατι χεῖρες ἄαπτοι ‖ μαιμῶσιν . Cp . Lycophron 1171 μαιμῶν κορέσσαι χεῖρα διψῶσαν φόνου ,

The fut . nidd . ἀροῦμαι occurs in O . C . 460 σωτῆρ ’ ἀρεῖσθε , and Pind . P . I . 75 ἀρέομαι . . μισθόν .
The fut . act . dρεῶ has better Ms . authority here ; but is ( I am now convinced) wrong .
It could mean only , ‘raise thy cowardice , ’ in the sense , ‘allow thy coward fears to rise , ’ — - a very forced one .
Further , there is no other example of a fut . act . ἀρῶ with ἄ . See note in Appendix on the Future and Aorist forms from ἀείρω , αἴρω , ἄρνυμαι .
276 ἔνβον ἀρκείῳ μένων ; for the personal constr . ( instead of ἀρκείτω αὐτὸν ἔνδον μένειν ) , cp . 635 : Ast . 547 ἀρκέσω θνήσκουσ ’ ἐγῳ ; O . T 1061 ἄλις νοσοῦσ ’ ἐγώ .

78 ἐχθρός yι . Odysseus refrains from replying that Ajax was then sane , but now is frenzied .
‘Yes , ’ he answers , ‘my foeman , - as he is still . ”
That enmity , he means , will now be more dangerous than 79 οὔκουν γέλως ἔἥδιστος . . ;
The godes suggests the vulgar sentiment of mankind , not as approwing it , but , as it were , to test the disposition of Odysseus ; who passes it by in silence , and afterwards repudiates it by his action .

The κύλιξ was a shallow vessel , and the epithet properly applies not to the goblet , but to the draughts of wine from it .
1201 . τέρψιν is first governed by νεῖμεν , and the same word is then repeated as a cognate accusative with tavety ,
1202 - 4 , οὔτε γλυκὺν . . . ἰαύειν ] ‘And from the sweet sound of flutes , unhappy me , and from passing nights of pleasant rest . ’

For μέριμνα in a gpod sense , cp . especially Pind , Pyth . 8 , 126 - 132 , ὁ δὲ καλόν τι νέον λαχὼν | ἁβρότατος ἔπι , peγάλας | ἐξ ἐλπίδος πέταται | ὑποπτέροις ἀνορέαις , ἔχων | κρέσσονα πλούτου | μέριμναν: also Ο . Τ ' 1124 , ἔργον μεριμνῶν ποῖον ;
