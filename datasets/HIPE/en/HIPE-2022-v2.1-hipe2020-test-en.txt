NEW - YORK , SEPT . 28 , 1780 .
SIR , W E have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to tranlinit effec ¬ tual Amendments to the Conftitution of the Uni ¬ ted Stares , and it is with grief that we now fend forward propolitions inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments , and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our country .

We fltall tranfmit a com ¬ plete let of the Journals of both Houfes of Con - grefsto your addrefs , which with a letter accom panying them , we entreat your Excellency will have the gaodnefs to lay before the Honorable Legillature of the enfuing meeting .
We have the honor , of every ( entiment of rc - fpeCt , to be , Sir , your Excellency ’ s moft obedient , and very humble fervants , RICHARD HENRY LEE WILLIAM GRAYSON .
 PRESIDENT SULL IVAN ’ s MESSAGE .
To the Hon .
Senate and House ^ / ' Represen ¬ tatives , [ 0 / New - Hampshire . ] Gentlemen , H HVING been informed , that doubts have a - rifen iu the minds of fome , whether my hav ¬ ing accepted the office of Diftricft Judge has not difqualified me from aefling as Prefident of the State , until a new election takes place , I confefs that 1 have never been able to difcover any in ¬ compatibility in the two offices .
But as fome have attempted to prove this by urging the words of aConflitution framed for thepurpofe of efta - blifhing over the people of New - Humpfhire a free , fovereign and independent government — 1 mull obferve , that this govennent has [ nice been changed by the voice of the people , who have agreed that their fafety depended on their relinquifhuig many of the powers retained by the people in that Conflitution , to a General Government eflabl ' fbed for the people of each and every State who fnould adopt it ; which to themwai to become the general law of the land .
The people of this State did , in the moff folemn manner , a dipt arid ratify that Conflitution ; and from that e - vent , this ceased to be a free , sovereign , andindependent state ; and upon my being elcdled to the office of Prefident , I was only fworn to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as Prefident of a free and confederate State ; and I was at or near the fame time fworn to fupport the Confti union of the United States , by virtue ofalaw enacted by yourfelves .
I was appointed under that Conflitution which the people of New - Hampffiire had adopted for themfelves , a Judge of the Federal Court .
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the people , and could not devife a way of re - figning the truft committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it .
I well knew that the time for electing a new Prefident was near at hand , when the people might have an op ¬ portunity of declaring who fhould prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been en - trufted to my care , and the affairs of the State un ¬ folded to me , I could not , without an unpardona - ble breach of truft , negleifl to lay them before you .
I alfo confidered , that while I was living in the State , no other perfon could , by your own laws , adminilter the neceffary oaths to you , to qualify you to aeft as Legifiators , while the time for which I was chofen was not expired ; and as I knew that this would probably be the laft feflion of this Court , for the prefent year ; and I had no inclination to propofe myfelf as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have pre ¬ vented fome perfons from purfuing the methods they have adopted , for gratifying a fpirit which ought never to lodge itfelf in the branch of a Legifla - ture .
Gentlemen , You will fee the fituation I am in , and may eafily conceive of my feelings upon this fubjeeft , being brought forward , at every opportunity , to fa ’ - tiate that fpirit which has often , before this fejjion of the Court , difplayed itfelf before me , and ufed every effort againfl me .
The Prefident and Senate of the United States were , at the time of my appointment , well ac ¬ quainted with my having to finifh my year in prefiding over this State ; but no hint has ever been given tome of my acceptance of an office under the prefent general government , rendering void any State appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often , fince my accep ¬ tance of the office of Diftridl Judge for New - Hampfttire , in company with the Prefident of the United States , who knew I was the Prefident of this State , and treated me as fuch , although he at the fame time knew that I had long before accept ¬ ed the office of Federal Judge .
I know the candour and juftice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightnefs to fuppofe , that they will fuffer themfelves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more , who cannot avoid at every opportunity , difeovering the fpirit which alhi - ates them in their conduB .
I have the honour , & c .

The official account of the capture ofBruffels pnbliflied by the Patriots , is as under .
It is dated the 12tli of December .
“ At length , notwithftanding the armifiice , and every other pretence , joo brave Patriots of Brufiels have dared to engage in battle with 6poo Aullrains .
The action commencedyelterday af ¬ ternoon , at four o ’ clock .
The firft attenpt was.tp make prifoners of all the loldiers who guarded the Mint , and thofe who were quartered in the different converts .
General D ’ Alton did his tu ¬ rnoff from fix o ’ clock in the morning to negociate an armifiice .
About ( even o ’ clock , 8co men of Benden - D ’ Aloft entered the city with two pieces of cannon , which they planted on the Grand Pa ¬ lace .
About ten o ’ clock General D ’ Alton thought proper to fend a large dctatchment in order to releafe , by forcible means , the ollicers and pri ¬ vates made prifoners in lhe Bafleville .
This was the fignal for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its victory .
The Patriots no longer able to contain themfelves , routed the whole detatchment .
To the number of joo , at the utmoft , they invelled the great market , and after a mod obllinatc conflict , they made them ¬ felves mafters of the Coros de Garde , and two pieces of cannon , and took obotlt 400 Auftrians prifoners .
About the fame time the engagement re - commenced in all quartersof the city ; and , in lefs than two hours , the Patriots made themfelves matter of the barracks of the military andofthe magazines , in which they found near 2,000 muf - kets , befides cartridges , ammunition , & c .
To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the Park and the Pal ¬ ace Royale , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or cannon .
After a very heavy firing on both fides , D ’ Alton perceiving that the place was no longer tenable againtt fo much bravery , capitulated for the im ¬ mediate retreat of his whole gerrifon ; and the requell having been acceded to , about one o ’ clock they departed , with great precipitation , through the Porte de Namur .
But as all the foldieis arc not equally inclined to follow hinj , at the mo ¬ ment this is writing , they are fquabbling among theinlelves , without the city .
Already , we have got more than 3,000 prifoners ; buta few killed , and no houfes plundered .
 For the Gazstte of the Unites States , i Letter I . TO THOMAS JEFFERSON , Vise President of the Unit .
!
States , Philad : July 3 , 1800 .
AS you are a candidate for the Supreme - Magistracy ot the United States , a know ¬ ledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country .
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in politi ¬ cal concerns , I would not have troubled you cr the public with these setters , since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then , Sir , have Aided down the current of Use in obscurity , and at least have had the consolation to know that your de ¬ formities were hidden from the world .
But , as , Sir , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the Presi - drncy , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your country may perhitps confide her dearest interest to .
It is my duty , as it is my wiffi , to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess , and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered America in the course of a long life busied with public cares , — - But , Sir , it is also my duty to speak ot those other qualities of your ' heart and mind which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country .
Nature , Sir , in profusion , gifted you witli talents , a brilliant fancy , penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction , combined with a thirst for knowledge , formed yqp a man of lea rung and taste , well acquainted with the classics , deeply read in the philoso - phy of natural history , observant of men and things , and attentive in theory to political concerns .
But , to balance tin fe singular favors , stie denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great nation , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable .
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your mind is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your closet you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of Nature ; but the fatigues , perseverance and firm Mnper , nectssiry in an Executive sta ¬ tion , would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened under ¬ standing useless to its possessor and injurious to his country .
Let me conjure you , Sir , to call to your remembrance the history of your political life , and from a regard to your peace and reputation , not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the Presidency .
You have been , Sir , a Governor , an Ambassador , and a Secretary of State , and had to desert each of these posts , from that weakness of nerves , want of fortitude and total imbecility of character , which have marked your whole political carier , and most probably will at ¬ tend you to your grave .
Remember , Sir , , all the services youevei rendered your coun ¬ try were of the literary kind—The Declara ¬ tion of Independence was penned in , your closet , where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that Declaration by any extraordinary exer ¬ tion , or by exposing yourself to any immi ¬ nent danger .
When Governor - os Virginia , you sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appoint ¬ ment by Congress .
A ; the danger was visi - ble , you acted consistently with your chr - racter , but surely did liot display either much firmness or patriotism .
But , Sir , weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are nayiral defects—they are not faults of your own—tho ’ were you , con ¬ scious of your desects , to accept the impor ¬ tant office of President , when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your country are depending , it would th my opinion , amount to a crime .
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the htad of a party devoted to the enemies of America , and a party created for her ruin .

 TO THE Cultivators oftlieSul THE AMERICA * FARMER .
T HE first number of the AMERICAN FARMER , was issued on the 2d of April 1819 .
It may now be announced as an es tablisbed National work , adapted to all the varieties of our climate , since many oi the most eminent citizens in all the states , con tribute by their patronage and their pens , to its circulation and its usefulness To make known all discoveries in the sci ence , and all improvements in the practice of Agriculture and Domestic Economy—and to develope the means and designate plans of internal improvements generally , consti tute the chief objects to which the American Farmer is devoted .
It takes no concern or interest in party politics , nor inthe transient occurrences of the day .
The Farmer is published weekly , on .
- heel the size of a large newspaper , and folded o as to make eight pages—and to ad ¬ mit of being conveniently bound up and preserved in volumes .
Each volume will consist of fifty - two numbers , a title page and an index ; and numerous Engravings to re ¬ present new implements , and approved sys ¬ tems of husbandry Each number gives a true and accurate statement of the th * m selling prices of coun ¬ try produce , live stock and all tbe principal articles brought for sale in the Baltimore market .
.
Terms of subscription 4 dollars per an ¬ num , to be paid in advance .
But for the ' ' Urn of five dollars , the actual receipt of eve ¬ ry number is guaranteed .
That , is , when numbers fail to come to hand , duplicates shall be sent until every number shalljiave been received .
As the Editor takes the risk and cost of die mail—should subscription money mis ¬ carry , he holds himself , nevertheless , bound to furnish the paper .
To those who may think the price of sub ¬ scription too high , it may be remarked , that on a comparison ol their actual contents , one volume of the American Farmer , will be found to containas much as four volumes ol the Memoirs of ihe Agricultural Society of Philadelphia and the four volumes of that I patriotic , and exceedingly valuable work , sell for 12 dollars .
To shew that the American Farmer , is conducted in a manner to answer the great national purpose for which it was * stablish - ed .
and that it is not on ieserving the encou ragementof the Agriculturists of the Unit ; d States , the following testimonials are respect fully submitted—others equally conclusive , might be offered .
Extract of a letter from Governor Lloyd , » • ho is acknowledged to be one of the most wealthy , well informed and best managing farmers in the United States .
“ The Farmer , so far , is the best Agricul tural compilation , m my humble opinion , that 1 have seen , and deserves the patron ¬ age of the public . ' ’ From the President of the Agricultural Soci ety . Eastern Shore of Maryland . 1 am anxious to preserve the whole of the work , and wish it was in the hands of every lamer in the United States . It is by the diffusion of knowle dge only , that we can expect our country to improve in Agricul ture , which thy paper is admirably calcula ted to impart , to all who will take pains to be improved by reading . ”

From a letter received in this place from a gentleman of intelligence , and from our exchange papers which come to us from different sections of the country , we have the utmost assurance in saying that the Indian cause is gaining ground .
There is a great excitement on this sub ¬ ject and this excitement is extending .
Meetings have been held in New York , Philadelphia , New Haven and Hartford , and memorials to Congress adopted—oth ¬ er meetings ill other places will be held .
From the abstract of the debate in the House of Representatives , on the question of referring the New York memorial to the Committee on Indian Adairs , which our readers will find in aliother part of our paper , there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of Congress ,
 Washington , January 25 , 1830 - Gentlemen .
Your letter of the I8ih has been re ¬ ceived .
We feel highly gratified to learn , that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable meeting in New - York , against the violation of ’ he trea ¬ ties with the Cherokee and other na ¬ tions of Indians , meets your approba ¬ tion .
In vindicating the sacred right of the citizen to petition government on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respec ¬ table meeting of our fellow citizens , on a subject involving the faith of the nation , its honor and character ; and the existence of a race of men .
now the remnant of a on - e powerful nation ; we did no more than perform a duty ■ incumbent on us .
as the representa ¬ tives of a free people .
We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration , of what we said on the interesting occasion to which you re ¬ fer .
We are , most lespectfully , Your obedient servants , A SPENCER HENRY R . STORRS .

It is sup ¬ posed that the decent members will not at ¬ tempt business until the rowdies have ex ¬ hausted themselves—or the House been purged after a general knock down and drag out .
There has as yet been no bloodshed , except a little scratching and hair - pulling iu the lobby .
The Senate has done some busi ¬ ness , has passed the Sub - Treasury Bill , and seems inclined to be decent , though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock up the sand scene ’ good as you sir , ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir , ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — afiiiir between an old and young one , Messrs . Clay aud Walk ¬ er tother day - Why will 31 r .
Clay disturb the harmony of the Senate , and rutile ( lie even current of his unaspiring course by such discordant scrapes ?
 From the Otmndagiia ( N . A . ) Standard .
The plan for disciplining the militia , pro ¬ posed by Mr . poinsett , w ould cost only half a million of dollars annually ; while that proposed by Gen . Harrison , with the present number ot our militia , would cost about FOUR MIL ¬ LIONS OF DOLLARS aunually .
Gen . Harrison proposed to place the whole force , brought under discipline on his system , distinctly w ithin the control of Ihe President .
On the 3d of February last , Gen . Ilarrisou addressed a letter to the “ Louisville Legion , ” in which he mentioned the plan here brought to view as one ofhis principal efforts to im ¬ prove the discipline ofthe militia .
And furthermore , Gen . Harrison ’ s keepers have assured the public , that his sentiments have undergone “ no change . ”
Of course , then , Gen . Harrison would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official statiou , if placed in the Presidential chair , the odious and oppressively burthen - some scheme proposed by him iu a repot t to Congress .
Now , when the Western State Journal de ¬ nounces Gen.Harrison splan for organizing the militia , tho world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by Mr . Poinsett , and which has never received ihe approval of Mr . Yan !

 From the Pennsylvanian .
Harrisburg , June 26 , 1S40 .
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the 17th iust .
, as well as another let ¬ ter of similar import , dated 16th inst .
, tender ¬ ing to me a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you , just on the eve of my depar ¬ ture from Philadelphia .
It is a matter of re ¬ gret to me , that time , and my other indispen ¬ sable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered hospitality Allow mo to return my warmest thanks for the “ high regard and esteem ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meri ¬ torious services .
” I cannot , and I ought not to suppose , that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have dis ¬ tinguished the history of Pennsylvania since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her government , every official act I may find it necessary to perform , and every recommendation I may feel called on to make , should meet with unanimous approval .
It would be as unreason ¬ able as it w ’ ould be vain to look for this .
Some of the questions that have agitated Penn ¬ sylvania , and required my action upon them , are among the most intricate and perplexed iu the whole science of government , aud have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion , in the minds of the wisest and best men in this , aud other countries .
How , then , can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours , where habit , feeling , interest aud intelligence are so variously di ¬ versified and combined in their influence upon different individuals ?
At the time when the executive functions ol Pennsylvania passed into my hands , I found them beset with difficulties on all sides .
An overwhelming public debt—the interest seini - anuually falling due upon it—a stupen ¬ dous system of public improvements disjoint ¬ ed and unfinished—a banking system , involv ¬ ing an enormous amount of incorporated capital , directly or indirectly connected with the most ofthe business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details iudubitable proofs of its uusoiindness and imperfection—the banking institutions strug ¬ gling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprizo paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended , and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow , without knowing wheii it would fall , or on what portion with the great ¬ est weight .
Such were some of the porten ¬ tous embarrassments encountered at the out ¬ set of my ollicial career , and the worst evils they portended have been fully realized .
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise , and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the people , according to my solemn convictions of out ) ' , and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost responsibility of my station .
1 assert no claim to infallibility or judgment , or to a share ef wisdom superior to others , but to undeviatiug houesty of purpose I do avow that I have a title , of which no human power can deprive me .
Forming ps the Executive does , but a por ¬ tion ofthe Legislative power of this common ¬ wealth , he is often reduced to the unavoida ¬ ble necessity , of sanctioning measures which do not iu all respects meet his approbation , or to prevent , by refusing such sauetiou , any legislation on the subject at all .
Iu several Distances I have found myself in this dilem ¬ ma , when my only choice was , between the two evils of an imperfect law , and no ' egisla - tive action whatever .
Iu such cases I have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none , and have generally yielded my assent , even though I had objections to some parts of the law .
7 ’ he lato resolutions providing for the time of resuming specie payments by the batiks was one of this description .
I thought at the time and still think tha day fixed was too remote , hut I believed the permanent in ¬ terests of the community required that a day should be designated as speedily as possible for that event , and if it was not so grossly un ¬ reasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the time uncertain aud indefinite , I should uot prevent it becomiug a law .
It was , moreover , a subject on which the Legislature had deliberated for months , and the ' fixing the precise day on which it should take place , being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle , a decent re ¬ spect for the opinions of the people ’ s repre ¬ sentatives , a majority of whom , in both bran ¬ ches , were elected by men of my own politi ¬ cal faith , seemed to forbid the propriety of in ¬ terposin ' * the negative power , with which the constitution had clothed the Executive .
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best , in whatever aspect it could be viewed .
Accord inw to the theory and practice of our govern ¬ ment , legislation is a matter of compromise on inostlmbjects .
No one co - ordinate de ¬ partment has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar seutiments , on the part ofthe others .
All that either can do , is to take care that none of its essential prin ¬ ciples of constitutional construction , or public policy , shall be violated by the others ; when that is done , the remaining circle of duties cau be performed in a spirit of mutual conces - [ sion and compromise .
This is the doctrine of the constitution , the voice of the people , and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the government in harmony and goodwill .
7 ’ his principle affords the expla ¬ nation of my approval of more measures than one , against portions of which I had objec ¬ tions ; aud it is the only pretext on avhich the Legislature has refused or omitted to sanction recommendatjous of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this commonwealth .
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the Legislature on this subject , and it is fof the public to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the Legis ¬ lature , or that body right in refusing to adopt them .
I am gratified , however , in this , that iu most of the views embodied iu my recom ¬ mendations , the majority of the House of Re - pi eseutatives coincided with me in opinion , aud a number ofthe Democratic members of the Senate .
They failed , however , of success , and the remedy is in the hands of the people , if they approve of those measures , at the next election .
If they do not , whatever consequen ¬ ces follow , I have done my duty .
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this commonwealth , it will be found , I think , that though much has been left undone , « great deal has been accomplished .
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements , sustaining the faith and credit of the state , and terminating the present dis ¬ astrous suspension of specie payments , with provision which secures the public agaiust ar like recurrence in future , under a forfeiture of their charters by the banks ; and so far as de ¬ pends on me , will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced .
7 ' he improvement bill , it is univer ¬ sally admitted , coutains less objectionable matter than can be fouud in any prior legis ¬ lation on that subject .
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance ^ that the long practiced system of log - rolling , which has impoverished our treasury to the amount of some millions , is at au end .
7 he precise nature ofthe difficulties we have labored under , in achieving this much , can only be learned by those who examine with care and caudor into our real condition .
All thepecuniary responsibilities , as well as the re ¬ sources of Pensylvania , must be taken into the account , in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued .
YY ’ e must take things as they are .
YY ' e cannot retrieve wbat was done by our predecessors ; and those who expect us fr > act as if Pencj - lrnnia had no pub ¬ lic debt to provide for , uo unfinished improve ¬ ments to complete , no public interests to be protected , betray an ignorance of our true sit ¬ uation that entitles either the censure or their praise to very little regard .
7 ' he favorable o - piuiun of those , who , like the gentlemen I ad ¬ dress , are familiar with the true interests ofthe citizens of Pennsylvania , is a gratifying en ¬ couragement to the public man .
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed , those who understand what the best interests of Pensylvania are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them .
Even though those endeavors should not in all mi ¬ nute respects correspond with their own pe ¬ culiar sentiments .
Differing iu mere matters of detail , I feel convinced that iu all the great principles of public policy , the democratic party of Pennsylvania entertaius but one fun ¬ damental system of opinion .
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good government .
Recent experience has confirmed this opiuion , and assured me that time and experieuce are the great champions of the democratic cause .
I trust the recent aud existing embarrassments of our situation and the means to obviate them , will clearly illustrate this truth .
I am certain that Penn ¬ sylvania surrounded as she has been by diffi ¬ culties on all hands , cau aud will be soon ex ¬ tricated , — that all evils complained of will be corrected , — abuses reformed , - — her contracts fulfilled , and every duty of government be faithfully performed , without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the democratic party of Pennsylvania has ever held dear .
Please accept , gentlemen , for yourselves individually , the assurauce of my high regard and consideration .

 THE HEW COUNTY BRIDGE AND < * SCHOOL , HOUSE .
Tlie new county bridge over the James river , just south of town , is completed and ready for public patronage .
Its entire length is 160 leet , and its substruction is built of 12x12 timbers , with a covering 16 leet wide , made of 7 inch plank , with a railing 3 feet high on each side .
The bridge was constructed by Peter Auberton of this city .
Mr . Auberton also took the ^ contract for building the village school house for this place , which he expects to have done by the first of February .
The school building is 30x42 , 28 feet high above the stone foundation—which stands 2 feet above the ground There is a partition , cutting off 12 feet from the front of th ^ building , to be used for a stairway and entry room , leaving the school room on the first floor 30 feet square .
The front porch which faces toward the south , is 8x12 , and gracefully ornamented with different kinds of scroll work .
The cupola or belfry , is 8 feet square and very neatly finished .
The height from the top of the flag staff on the cupola to the ground is 62 feet high .
The structure is in every way first class , and cost about $3000 .
' Mr . Auberton bos done a great deal of work for Stutsman county , having built the court house early in the fall , and we understand that bis work has thus far given entire satisfaction .
 A Bit oT Daring .
A Western paper tells the story of Steve Venard ’ s fight with three rob ¬ bers in 1866 .
The stage coming to Nevada , Col .
, had been robbed by three men , and the treasure - box taken .
A party set out for its recovery .
Yenard , armed with a Henry rifle , followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rug ¬ ged region .
The hills hung steep above .
The waters of the ravine came tumbling down its steep bed of bowl ¬ ders with a rush and a noise which ren ¬ dered no other sounds audible .
Yenard attempted to cross the stream at the head of the fall .
He walked on a short log to a rock .
Above him rose the huge mass of granite , buttressed in front by two smaller rocks .
Between these latter was an alley which led to the base of the Titan .
His position was suen as to look up the alley .
At the base of the great rock Yenard discov ¬ ered the leader of the gang sit ¬ ting on the ground drawing his revolver .
Venard leveled his rifle upon the robber , twenty feet distant .
At the same time he saw an ¬ other of the gang pointing at him over the edge of a rock .
There was no time to change his aim .
He fired ; the leader fell back , shot through the heart .
The other robber attempted to shield him self farther behind a rock , leaving the point of his pistol exposed over the top .
Venard covered the spot with his unerring Henry , and when the head of the robber peered over the top hi3 brain was pierced with a bullet .
There was yet another , but he was not to be seen .
His pistol might at that mo ¬ ment be pointing at Yenard .
The latter clambered up to beard him in his den .
He found the treasure , took the pistols from the dead , covered quickly the former with earth and leaves , and proceeded to hunt the missing robber .
He found him running up the mount ¬ ain , sixty yards or more ahead .
Ve ¬ nard fired and the robber fell .
Another bullet , and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead .
 TUB SCHOOL BOARD : Just what our school board propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear , but it ia safe to predict that no lady teacher will get the school .
The majority of the board are very much opposed to such an arrangement , and so long as they are our people have but little to fear from them in that direction .
W « believe that the board desire to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the people .
Mr . Lees , as well as Mr . McKechnie , stated to us not long since , that they would not in any degree favor the in ¬ stallment of a lady teacher , but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests ot the people .
We do not oppose the hiring of a lady teacher because we are particularly preju ¬ diced against them , for we are not , and believe that some of the most reliable and able teachers that bless our land to - day are ladies .
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present , and we are of tbo opinion that we cannot , could a lady teacher , with no more than ordinary abili ¬ ty do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the county will agree with us when we answer most emphatically , no .
If our county was able to stand the extra ex ¬ pense we would be In favor of hiring two teachers instead of one .
Could we see our way clear in this direction we would then favor the engagement of a lady teacher whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department , leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the haads of a capable gentle ¬ man teacher .
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against Mrs . Shoe ¬ maker , and en that account are opposed to her being engaged is basely false .
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately , in regard to Mrs . Shoemaker which would in any way convey the idea that vre are personally prejudiced against her .
We are not in favor of her teaching the school for the same reasons that we would oppose any other lady teacher who might be endeavoring to get it .
 A little over a year ago the Stur ¬ geon Lendcr published a very sensa ¬ tional account of the marriage of Miss Nettie White to Robt .
L . Winn .
Miss White.at the time , was engaged to both Chas .
and Robt .
Winn , two brothers , but had much difficulty in deciding which of her lovers was the wbichest .
Robt .
, however , proved to be the successful suitor .
The young couple recently agreed to dis ¬ agree , and the faithless Robt .
left for Texas , and the young wife re ¬ turned to the home of her parents , and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant spouse upon the grounJs of desertion .
The pros ¬ pects for a re - hearing for the dis ¬ consolate Charles , who has spent the intervening time in repining , are growing very bright , as the young lady now declares that she really loved Charles best in tbe first place .
 The firm of Geo .
D . Barnard iSr Co . , of St . Louis , a firm which some officials in this county give a great many orders for letter beads , envel - ' opes and such other blanks as could be furnished by the printing offices in this county , arc all Republicans , but Mr . Keene , their traveling sales ¬ man in this territory , we understand , is a Democrat .
We have been in ¬ formed , upon good authority , that Messrs . Barnard & Co . are not uni ¬ form in their prices .
For instance , ’ a certain blank book they have beer * known to sell in Montgomery county for $17 .
In St . Charles county they place “ a tariff ” of SI ' , on the same book , and in Lincoln county the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from ” $21 for the very same book .
We presume their prices arc made in proportion to the number of pocket - knives , gold pens , etc . , they give away to capture an order .
If Democratic county of ¬ ficials will send their orders abroad for job work , let them , at least , pat ¬ ronize Democratic firms .
 Curiosities of the Postage Stamp .
There are about 6,000 varieties of postage stamps now iu use by the different nations of the world .
The museum of the Berlin post - cfllce alone contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens , half of which are European and the remain ¬ der divided between tbe Americans , Asia , Africa and Australia .
The emblems upon the stamps of nations are legion ; the earth , the sea and the vaulted canopy above have been ransacked for curious and mraning less devices and legends .
The en ¬ tire animal kingdom , the stars and the moon iu all its phases , besides legendary emblems by the thousand , are known to the oollLctors of stamps , who pride themselves upon being “ philatelists . ”
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be fonri * } the fogies of five em ¬ perors , eighteen kings , three q icens , one grand duke , several inferior tilled rulcr9 and many presidents .
M . Pliillippe de Ferrari perhaps has the largest and most valuable collec ¬ tion of stamps in the world , amount ¬ ing to something like 2ft0,000 , and within tbe present year he solJ one little stamp to a collector in Paris for 150.000 .
 In England and other parts of Europe , horseshoes are now in use , made of cowhide instead of iron .
The shoe is composed of three thick ¬ nesses of the hide which is pressed into a solid steel mould and after ¬ ward treated by a chemical process .
It is said to be far superior , in sev ¬ eral particulars , to the iron shoe .
 AGRICULTURE ON THE YUKON .
Wheut .
Vr ( jet » bl « uml Sum 11 Fruit * Will Grow There .
Vice Consul Morrison of Dawson City , sends to Washington a report on the results of agricultural experiments , written by a resident of that day .
which reads in part , as follows : " Grain has done exceptionally well , being well filled , and I see no reason why It should not be extensively and success ¬ fully grown here .
As far as my obser ¬ vations go .
the climate here is as suit ¬ able for raising winter wheat as in any place in the northwestern or the north ¬ ern states of America .
From my ex ¬ perience of the last two years .
1 see no reason why this country should not be able to produce its owu vegetables and grains .
As for flowers , the success I have had proves that all hardy annuals will do well .
The coming year I in ¬ tend planting several hundred hybrid roses , also summer flowering bulbs , a large variety of other hardy aud half - hardy annuals , and some of the hardy perennials .
Small fruit , such as straw ¬ berries .
currants .
blackberries and raspberries should do well .
Currants , raspberries , cranberries , strawberries and blueberries crow wild here .

 The Shirt Waist .
Very inviting are the displays of Ox ¬ fords , cheviots , zephyrs and madras cloths for the shirt waist , and the made - up models have already pushed out of place their winter representa ¬ tives in cloth , velvet and fine llannels .
We shall wear the comfortable wools , aye , and even buy them for some time to come , but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the thinner suc ¬ cessors .
A pretty feature in the wash waist for next summer is their sim ¬ plicity .
The human form divine is to have a chance to breathe once more , for the voluminous starchy fronts arc no more .
Even those professing to be loose have no surplus material , and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain , fitted over shoulders and bust and buttoned simply down the back .
Red dotted swiss has the entire front crossed In diamonds ^ of white val insertion , the undarted front Just puck ¬ ered a little at the belt , the plain back closed with bullet - shaped pearl buttons .
The close sleeves have a tight cult , and the simple , unlined col ¬ lar has little oblong turnovers of Swiss and Valenciennes lace .
Another style for these buttou - up - the - back waists Is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting .
Ibis Is of the styte which is purchased ready tucked and joined , and saves infinite labor , besides being nicer than the most careful home seamstress could make it .
Madras waists , aiso so fastened , have a slender - rest of tucking , running down to a point at the waist , and have little re - vers from the neck f o the bust on each side .
These are also of tucking and simply finished with a frill of narrow lace .
Large collars and full , fussy re - vers are not shown at all .
There is every evidence that the 1900 summer girl proposes , above all , to be sweetly cleanly .
Her waists say plainly enough that it will be a simple matter to wash and Iron them , and there need be no lack In their number for that reason .
One feature which marks them ns new and far prettier than the old shirt waists is the entire absence of yokes of any kind , even In the back .
The only semblance of a yoke is the one which is trimmed and applied to the shoulders , forming a little epaulet over the sleeves .
The backs of the semi ¬ full front waists are tucked and plaited to correspond with the front .
There are stiff linen cuffs , with rounded cor ¬ ners and detachable collars , which can be discarded altogether for the more becoming stocks , and long silk scarfs tied twice around the neck .

 FOREIGN WORDS .
Soma General Rule * That Will Aid In Pro ¬ nouncing Them .
Many foreign words have become a part of tlie English language through frequent use and It Is wise and proper to pronounce them according to rules of English .
There are , on the other hand , ninny words that do not readily lend themselves to the English style of pronunciation , or that are not used often enough to warrant it .
In pro ¬ nouncing such words the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the foreign languages .
In Latin two vowels are not put In one syllable unless they are joined as a diphthong .
There are as many syl ¬ lables as there are vowels in a word .
( Si ' - ne di ' - e for sine die . » In German , the letter w has tlie sound of v in English . ( Vahg ' - ner for Wagner . )
Tlie same is true in French , though w is only found in words that have been borrowed from other lan ¬ guages .
The letter i in German and in the Latin tongues , viz : French , Italian and Spanish lias tlie sound of long e .
( Peek for pique , Fr . : Bee ' - an - ko for Bianco , It . ; I > ee ' - os for Dios , Sp . )
In the Latin tongues , also , the letter a generally , though not always has the broad sound , while the letter o has the long sound .
Tlie letter c in I tali : n when fol ¬ lowed by e or i 1ms the sound of eh .
( Viu ' - cliee for Vinci . )
Final consonants in French are nearly always silent .
( Pah for Pas . )
So also is final e silent unless , an accent mark is placed above it .
The aecentiMl e has the sound of long a in English or a sound quite close to that .
The syllables in French words are never accented as in English words .
All of them are supposed to receive equal emphasis , but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into tlie next word us is often done .
The French make frequent use of nasal vowels , so - called , tlie correct pronunciation of which ' o difficult to acquire .
The nasal vowel is composed of a vowel and a consonant—m or n .
The consonant is practicelly silent , but serves to give tlie nasal tone to the vowel .
The pronunciation of the word salon , ( for example ) as given In Web ¬ ster ’ s dictionary .
Is sa - loug ' .
It should be observed that in the front of tlie dietionary it is explicitly stated that this ng is silent , being used only to convey the idea of tin * nasal sound .

 Why does Great Britian buy its oatmeal of us ?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to speak of exjxirt - ing oatmeal to Scotland and yet , every year the Quaker Oats Company sends hundreds of thousands of cases of Quaker Oats to Great Britian and Europe , The reason is simple ; while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically , and active mentally of all people , the American has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade .
How well he has succeeded would be seen at a glance at the export re ¬ ports on Quaker Oats .
This brand is recognized as without a rival in clean ¬ liness and delicious flavor .

 CRIMSON CLOVER I had a short article in last week ’ s Herald on the importance of crimson clover , and I have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil .
Now .
I am not acquainted with all the farmers who have grown crimson clover ’ Putnam county and 1 wish I was .
I would have a great many more short articles published , but to any one who has grown this crotp and feels like recommending it to his farmer frieds please write a short piece and send to me or the Herald with your name signed , so we can see who has had the experience .
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of crimson clover : First , prepare - the seed bed well .
Make the seed / bed as for wheat or clover and sow 15 to 20 lbs .
of se6d to the acre and if there has be n other clover grown on the land recently inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise Inoculation should be ap ¬ plied .

Either get some soil from clover field or get the liquid inocula ¬ tion and inoculate the seed before sowing , but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the bright sunlight .
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in ’ the shade to dry and then sow in the early morning or in the evening or on .
a cloudy day with the harrow followig the seeding .
In this way the inoculation is ffectlve .
Apply when seeding cromson clover some 15 per cent acid phosphate from 100 to 300 pounds to the acre .
Tn this way the clover gets a good growth and the better the clover grows the more nitrogen it gathers and stores in .
the soil , consequently the better crop you get following the crimson clover .
* If you are sowinf for a pas ¬ ture and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of rye with the crimson clover .
It will fur ¬ nish more pasture and help to hold the clover .
Hoping to see your testimony of growing crimson clover in the paper next week , if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow , let us hear from you .

 CLEARING UP THE EDENTON CENSUS COUNT Edentonians have berm raising quite a squawk over the census re ¬ turns , They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their ! duties , that the carriers beak ; cf the Edcnton pnsloff.ee show that the poslofficc serves approximate ¬ ly 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they arc clamoiing for a new enumeration .
In the efTia * of the District Supervisor of Census , this is cla .
s - id as Chamber ef Csmmcrcc and press ballyhoo .
Edentonians have been boasting ‘ for several years that the population ol their town was more than 5,000 J when the official count revealed only 3.519 . Edentonians ware dis ¬ appointed and began to grumble . Several s * dulous busybodies , anxious to boost the population of their town , borrowed the carrier ’ s books from the postofTice and counted all the names therein . They found nearly 4.500 names in the books . And immediately a cry was raised . ‘ Wc want , a new tabulation . There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us . "
Bui it was just so much hokum , in the opinion of a representative ol the District Supervisor ' s office . If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edcnton ' s population is ever the 4.000 mark , they didn ' t succeed in fooling anyone else . When a person or a family moves to a town , the name is placed in the car ¬ rier ' s bock . But . when they leave town , their names are not struck off the boc ! ; . Go everyone who moved to Edcnton from 1920 to 1930 was ugislucd in the postofTice carriers lyckx , and the names of everyone v , ho moved from Edenton in that ■ ■ pried of time were not removed from the bocks . Edentonians even wonted to in - ' elude in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians ' work ¬ ing away from Edenton , but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by Uncle Gam . So the official census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519 . Eden - tonians ’ protests to the conti aiy notwithstanding .

 Florida Court Sidesteps THE FLORIDA SUPREME Court has declined to order admission of five Negroci to the state - supported University of Florida .
By unanimous vote , the couit uphela a plan of the state board of control to enroll all race students at the Florida A . & M . College for Ne - groes , and give those desiring courses not offered at the Negro school temporary instruction at the white insti - , Ut The opinion stated that the plan to provide tem ¬ porary instruction at the white institutions until “ ade - quate and comparative facilities are offered at the Ne - gro institution meets all requirements of thr federal THE RULING further states that the temporary arrangement ‘ conforms as nearly as it can with due re ¬ gard to the paramount federal law , with the long estab . li ' shec . policy of the state of Florida that there shall be a system of segregation of the races in the state school sivstem but that impartial provisions shall be made o the schools for white and Negro schools alike . ”
There is no greater farce than the diabolically “ sep ¬ arate . but equal ” system in educational institutions and public carriers of which the Southland adheres to so tenaciously . Several of the southern states , notably . Texas Arkansas , and Oklahoma , have let down their bars of segregation , and have agreed to abide by the Supreme Court ruling of admitting Negroes into the white s f nte - supported institutions . IT SEEMS that the learnea judges of the Florida Supreme Court have “ strained at a mountain and pro ¬ duced a knat ” Certainly , the action of there Florida scions does not represent the New South , but rather the echoes of ante bellum days . Florida , the land of sunshine , oranges and kumquot ? is out of step with other progressive southern state * The lawmakers of that state should drink from their own Fountain of Youth , and thus become invigorated re - born and revivea ’ from their apparent stupidity , and like men - wise and judicious - mete out justice to all men alike .
THIS ‘ ♦ TEMPORARY * educational setup decreed bv the unanimous decision of the Florida Supreme Court is an unfair judicial enactment . While it may serve a « an appeasement to some of the southern die hards , it cannot stand . Like the Morning Glory vine , it may flourish for a season , but i f s da vs are numbered And these Florida solons think they have by - passed the VS . Supreme Court ’ s decision .
‘ What fools some mortals be .

In addressing the League , Mrs . Fuqua explained the purpose of the League , its achievements and how it can function in a com ¬ munity .
knowing its national pos ¬ sibilities .
The president pointed out that women should be proud that they spend the “ must ' * dollars ; that is . the dollar for the home and that they could help by being a part of the growing Negro busi ¬ nesses . She stated that pool - buying would help Negro busi ¬ nesses to expand . Horace Sudduth . president of the National Negro Business League stated in his address to the Business and Housewives League ; ‘ There is nothing that will build our neighborhood business ¬ es on a competitive basis faster than the program that has been carried on by the Housewives League for the past 17 years . The effectiveness of this program has been proved wherever Housewiv ¬ es Leagues exist . We must have trong , functioning Housewives Leagues working side by side with every affiliated local league . We must carry them right along with us . As we grow strong , they will grow * strong . ”
Mrs . Fuqua urged all members and visitors of the fifteen states represented at the Convention who were engaged in new enter ¬ prises of manufacturing , to join the league or keep in touch with it in order that they may be pro ¬ moted .
Among the guests were : Mrs . H . F . Thomas .
Birming ¬ ham , Ala . , a rug and mattress manufacturer ; and Mrs . Freddvo S Henderson .
Atlanta , Ga . .
a fashion designer .
In stressing the theme of the convention , emphasis was put on pool buying to help our people buy gross instead of dozens : bar ¬ rels instead of gallons , bolts in ¬ stead of yards ; carloads instead of cases .
This will in turn build better stores where there are shops ; gar ¬ ages where there arc filling sta ¬ tions , storage houses where there are storerooms ; more employees where there are employers , com ¬ munities where there are slum homes churches as they should be ; schools where they arc need ¬ ed .
