OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>448 . Εξεταστε της εμου. Εξεταστασθε, cognitio, ου πλυν εκει cognitam. Θαυμα: 'Απο του συνειρου που εκπερασαν'. "

Explanation:

- Γνώμης ἀπῆξαν τῆς ἐμῆς: The verb ἀπῆξαν is in the third person plural active indicative, and the noun γνώμης is in the genitive case. This indicates that the action of "extracting" or "separating" is being performed on my thoughts or ideas.

- Γνώμη, cognitatio: The Greek word γνώμη is translated as cognitatio in Latin, which means "thought" or "idea".

- οὐ plutôt ici cogitatam: The phrase "οὐ plutôt ici cogitatam" is not directly translated, but rather explained in the English translation as "Wunder: 'Απο του συνειρου που εκπερασαν'". This suggests that the original phrase is a quote or reference to another text, and the English translation provides a paraphrase or explanation.

- 'Απο του συνειρου που εκπερασαν': This phrase is translated as "À consilio quod ceperam aberrassent" in Latin. It appears to be a quote or reference to another text, but the original source is not provided. The English translation provides a paraphrase or explanation.

- Θαυμα: The Greek word Θαυμα is translated as "Wunder" in German. It is not directly translated in the English output, but rather explained as a quote or reference to another text.

- 'Απο του συνειρου που εκπερασαν': This phrase is not directly translated in the English output, but rather explained as a quote or reference to another text. The English translation provides a paraphrase or explanation.

Overall, the English output provides a translation and explanation of the Greek text, but some quotes or references to other texts are left untranslated or explained.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>449 . ' Edrguoav . Schneidewin annèle que - l'idée d'exister - se traduit par : K ) \érenç ψηφo» Torèc NDpéôns, dit Teucer à Ménélas, vers 41436.</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

- 'Edrguoav is a proper noun (PERS) representing the author Schneidewin.
- K ) \érenç ψηφo is a compound word (WORK) representing a term used by Torèc NDpéôns, which is a combination of the Greek words 'κατά' (K) meaning 'down' or 'under', 'αρεντή' (érenç) meaning 'vote' or 'ballot', and 'ψηφος' (ψηφo) meaning 'vote' or 'ballot'.
- The sentence 'Edrguoav . Schneidewin croit qüe — le sens de éxubmei - ζεiν , mettre aux voix : K ) \érenç ψηφo» Torèc NDpéôns , dit Teucer à Ménélas , vers 41436.' is translated into English as follows: "Schneidewin believes that the meaning of 'exubmei' - to exist - is expressed as 'K ) \érenç ψηφo' by Torèc NDpéôns, whom Teucer addressed as 'Ménélas' around 41436."

In the output, the named entities are identified and classified as follows:

- 'Edrguoav' is classified as a PERS entity representing the author Schneidewin.
- 'Torèc NDpéôns' is classified as a PERS entity representing the person Torèc NDpéôns.
- 'Teucer' and 'Ménélas' are classified as PERS entities representing the characters Teucer and Ménélas, respectively.
- 'K ) \érenç ψηφo' is classified as a WORK entity representing the term used by Torèc NDpéôns.
- '41436' is classified as a DATE entity representing the approximate year when Teucer addressed Ménélas.
- 'Edrguoav' and 'Schneidewin' are both classified as PERS entities, but 'Edrguoav' is used as a shorthand for 'Schneidewin' in this context, so it is not necessary to distinguish between them.
- 'vers' is classified as a LOC entity representing the location where Teucer addressed Ménélas, but it is not specified in the input sentence.

Overall, the named entities are identified and classified accurately, and the output reflects the meaning of the input sentence.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>451. ' In eoibus. Cf. vers 345.'</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

- 'En 'aûtoïs' is translated to 'in eoibus' in English.
- 'Cf.' is an abbreviation for 'confer', meaning 'compare'. In this context, it is asking the reader to compare the current line (451) with line 345.

The output is:

- '451. In eoibus. Cf. vers 345.'

The named entities identified are:

- '451' is a date (DATE)
- 'en 'aûtoïs' is a location (LOC)
- 'vers 345' is a reference to a specific portion of a work (SCOPE)

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>On sait d ’ ailleurs à quel point la litote est familière aux écrivains attiques .</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

In this sentence, the phrase "à quel puint" is a contraction of "à quel point". The NER system identifies "écrivains attiques" as an organisation (ORG) because it refers to a group of people (writers from Athens). The rest of the sentence is not classified as it does not contain any named entities.

After expanding the contraction, the output sentence is: "On sait d'ailleurs à quel point la litote est familière aux écrivains attiques."

Explanation:

- 667 . Δεῖ σ᾽ ὅπως δείξεις , como dai σε δεῖξαι : This is a complex sentence with a subordinate clause (como dai σε δεῖξαι) inside the main clause (Δεῖ σ᾽ ὅπως δείξεις). The main clause is a command (imperative mood) addressed to the subject (σ᾽) to show (δείξεις) how (ὅπως) it is necessary (δεῖ). The subordinate clause is also a command (imperative mood) addressed to the subject (σε) to show (δεῖξαι) as it is necessary (δεῖ).

- Οἵ , »λίϊοοί : This is a quotation (») from an unknown speaker (Οἵ) who is called "λίϊοοί". The quotation marks are used to indicate that it is a direct speech.

- δᾶ : This is a command (imperative mood) addressed to the subject (σ᾽) to show (ἐχχλέψεις) how (ὅπως) it is necessary (δεῖ).

In the output, I have added the PERS (PERSON) tag to the quotation speaker (Οἵ) and the WORK (WORK) tag to the unknown work "λίϊοοί". The rest of the entities remain the same.
