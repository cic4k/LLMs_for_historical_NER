In this sentence, I identified the following entities:

- "A" as a <PERS>person</PERS>

I also added the "WORK" tag to the existing abbreviations "MS" and "MSS" to indicate that they refer to types of work. I added the "ADJ" tag to the word "correct" to indicate that it is an adjective modifying "MS".

In this sentence, there are no named entities that can be classified as person (PERS), organization (ORG), location (LOC), or physical objects (OBJECT). Therefore, I have classified the entities as follows:

* "A very" is classified as a date (DATE) because it refers to an unspecified time period.
* "few" is classified as a quantity (QUANTITY) because it refers to a small number.
* "divergencies" is classified as a human work (WORK) because it refers to a piece of work or a task.
* "accent" and "orthography" are also classified as quantities (QUANTITY) because they refer to specific aspects of language.
* "omitted" is not classified as any entity type because it is a verb and not a named entity.

 "<SENTENCE>This <PERS>possibility</PERS> is a <WORK>farther</WORK> reason for rejecting the notion that <PERS>Ajax</PERS> is really <WORK>guilty</WORK>.</SENTENCE>"

In this sentence, the named entities are identified as follows:

* "This" is not a named entity, so it is left unchanged.
* "possibility" is identified as a "WORK" because it refers to a concept or idea.
* "farther" is identified as a "WORK" because it refers to a degree or extent.
* "reason" is identified as a "WORK" because it refers to a justification or explanation.
* "notion" is identified as a "WORK" because it refers to a conception or idea.
* "Ajax" is identified as a "PERS" because it refers to a person.
* "guilty" is identified as a "WORK" because it refers to a state or condition.

Note that the identification of named entities can be subjective and may vary depending on the context and the specific criteria used for classification. In this example, I have used the criteria provided in the original request to identify the named entities.

In this sentence, the named entities have been identified and classified as follows:
- "Zeus" has been identified as a person (PERS).
- "Phoebus" has been identified as a person (PERS).
- "deities" has been identified as a human work (WORK).
- "divination" has been identified as a human work (WORK).
- "are implored" has been identified as a human work (WORK).
- "grant" has been identified as a human work (WORK).

- "report" has been identified as a human work (WORK).
- "set in motion" has been identified as a human work (WORK).
- "Argives" has been identified as a location (LOC).

Note that the classification of some entities as human work (WORK) may be subjective and open to interpretation.

In this sentence, I identified the following entities:

- "Attic" as a location (LOC)
- "accusative" as a human work (WORK)
- "general construction" as a human work (WORK)

Note that the entities "doing good or evil" and "what follows" are not standard types, but I have classified them as human work (WORK) since they refer to abstract concepts related to human actions.

In this sentence, there are no clear named entities that fall into the categories of person (PERS), organization (ORG), location (LOC), human work (WORK), date (DATE), specific portion of work (SCOPE), and physical objects (OBJECT). However, I have identified some words as "WORK" to represent the actions and objects in the sentence.

Here is the breakdown of the sentence:

* ἔχων - - κατέχων (<WORK>Or</WORK>, <SCOPE>2</SCOPE>) - The word "ἔχων" means "having" and "κατέχων" means "withholding". The word "Or" is a work (in this case, a literary work) and "2" is a specific portion of that work.
* <WORK>withholding</WORK> <SCOPE>from</SCOPE> <WORK>sight</WORK> - The word "withholding" is an action and "sight" is the object of that action.
* "Or (<WORK>Keeping</WORK> <SCOPE>thine</SCOPE> <WORK>eye</WORK> <SCOPE>fixed</SCOPE> <WORK>upon</WORK> <WORK>the</WORK> <WORK>tents</WORK> . - The word "Or" is a work, "keeping" is an action, "eye" is an object of the action, "fixed" is a description of the action, "upon" is a preposition, and "tents" is the object of the preposition.

In this sentence, there are no named entities that can be classified as person (PERS), organization (ORG), location (LOC), human work (WORK), specific portion of work (SCOPE), or physical objects (OBJECT). Therefore, the only entity identified is "tiius" as a date, which is likely a typo and not a recognized date format.

In this sentence, there are no named entities that can be classified as person (PERS), organisation (ORG), location (LOC), human work (WORK), date (DATE), specific portion of work (SCOPE), or physical objects (OBJECT).

 It seems that the input sentence contains some fragmented and unusual words or symbols, which might make it challenging to accurately identify and classify named entities. However, I will try my best to identify and classify the named entities based on the provided categories. Here is my attempt:

<SENTENCE>Glycon . <WORK>Epitrit . 2</WORK> , <SCOPE>_ 2</SCOPE> , <SCOPE>__ — 7 - “</SCOPE> , ττύωπυ - - - <WORK>Epitrit . 2</WORK> - - - - <WORK>Glycon</WORK> . <PERS>Glycon</PERS> . , [ <SCOPE>4 - - -</SCOPE> : <WORK>Ξ</WORK> : <WORK>out</WORK> <SCOPE>— — , , ( VE VAN</SCOPE> <WORK>Sati</WORK> </SENTENCE>

In this output, I have identified and classified the following named entities:

* "Glycon" as a <PERS> (person)
* "Epitrit . 2" as a <WORK> (work)
* "_ 2" and "__ — 7 - “" as <SCOPE> (specific portion of work)
* "Ξ" as a <WORK> (work)
* "out" and "Sati" as <WORK> (work)

Note that some of the identified entities might not be accurate due to the unusual and fragmented nature of the input sentence.

</SENTENCE>

In this sentence, the named entities are classified as follows:

* "κλυτός" is classified as a work (WORK) because it is a Greek word being discussed in the sentence.
* "Od." is classified as a work (WORK) because it is an abbreviation for the epic poem "Odyssey" by Homer.
* "9 . 308" is classified as a scope (SCOPE) because it refers to a specific line in the "Odyssey."
* "Tapaxas" is classified as a work (WORK) because it is a Greek word being discussed in the sentence.
* "φωνάς" is classified as a work (WORK) because it is a Greek word being discussed in the sentence.

* "infr." is classified as a human work (WORK), as it is an abbreviation for a work or document that has been mentioned previously.

* "ἄλημα" is classified as a physical object (OBJECT), as it refers to a cause or source of something.
* "Ἑλλήνων" is classified as a person (PERS), as it refers to a group of people who are Greeks.
