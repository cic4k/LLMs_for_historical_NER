In this input sentence, there are no named entities that match the provided types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT). Therefore, there are no additions to the input in the output.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>Ajax could not be himself ( <PERS>φρενήρηθ</PERS> ) and do this thing .</SENTENCE>"

In this example, "φρενήρηθ" is not a named entity of any of the given types, but it is annotated as a PERSON entity because it is a form of the name "Ajax" in ancient Greek. The context implies that it refers to Ajax's state of mind, but without further context it is impossible to determine if it should be annotated as a different type of named entity.

In this example, I identified the word "ὕβρις" as an object because it refers to a man-made physical object, specifically a type of object that is often cited in the context of classical studies. The word "ὕβρις" is an abstract concept, but in this context, it is being used to refer to a physical instantiation of that concept, such as a manuscript or artifact. The output includes the tag "<OBJECT>ὕβρις</OBJECT>" to indicate that this word has been identified as an object.
