Please identify and classify the named entities in the following sentence: "4803 . Σπέρμα . . . . πατρός . Οἱ . 4478 : πατρὸς ὅς σ᾽ ἐγείνατο ."
Generate according to: I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT. Next are the annotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated

Generate according to: I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT. Next are the annotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le,
