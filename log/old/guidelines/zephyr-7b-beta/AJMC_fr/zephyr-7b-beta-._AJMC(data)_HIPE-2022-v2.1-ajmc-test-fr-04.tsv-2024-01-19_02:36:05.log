Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")

However, we can still provide annotations for the named entities that might appear in similar contexts. Here's an example:

    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions
