Explanation:

In this case, the input sentence does not contain any named entities that fall into the defined categories. However, the text "OL" and "A" are capitalized, which could potentially indicate place names. Therefore, I have annotated them as <LOC> entities. If it becomes clear that these abbreviations do not refer to locations, the annotations can be removed.

Note that the output sentence still follows the required format, with the identified named entities delimited by <TYPE> tags.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>1469 . τοι O , Edd . re LA .</SENTENCE>"

No named entities were identified in this sentence as it does not contain any proper nouns or locations. Therefore, no annotation is required.

However, for reference, the abbreviations "Edd" and "O" are commonly used in Old Norse studies to refer to the "Edda" (a collection of Old Norse texts) and the "Old Norse language", respectively. These abbreviations should not be annotated as named entities in this context.

If the sentence were to include proper nouns or locations, they would be annotated as follows:

- "1469 . τοι O , Edd . re LA . Ἐν Αθήναις ( <LOC>Αθήναι</LOC> ) γεγονότα εἰσιν ( <PERS>γεγονόται</PERS> ) , ὅθεν ( <LOC>Αθήναι</LOC> ) καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν ἱερόν ( <WORK>τὸ ἱερὸν ἱερόν</WORK> , <SCOPE>Αθήναι</SCOPE> ) κατεστήθη ( <PERS>κατεστήθη</PERS> ) ."

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>The participle is slightly proleptic ( <WORK>as with πειρᾶσθαι</WORK> ) .</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

The participle referred to in the sentence is not explicitly named, but it is clear from the context that the author is discussing a specific participle. To accurately reflect this, we annotate the participle "πειρᾶσθαι" as a work, as it is a titled intellectual creation (in this case, a Greek verb). The participle being discussed is slightly proleptic, which means it anticipates the action of the verb it is derived from. By annotating "πειρᾶσθαι" as a work, we can easily identify the specific participle being referred to in future analyses.

Can you identify and classify the named entities in the given sentence according to the provided guidelines?
Generate according to: I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT. Next are the annotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated

Explanation:

In this example, the input sentence contains a quotation that does not have a clear work title or scope. Therefore, we annotate the quotation itself as a <WORK> entity, as it represents a distinct intellectual creation that can be referred to by its content. Note that we do not include the quotation marks or the ellipsis in the annotation, as they are not part of the named entity itself. The output sentence shows the quotation as a <WORK> entity, with no surrounding punctuation or white spaces.

<SENTENCE>We had <SCOPE>σκηναῖς</SCOPE> in the dialogue, <SCOPE>supr.</SCOPE> 1 3.</SENTENCE>

Explanation:

- The input sentence contains a reference to a scope entity, which is the Greek word "σκηναῖς" (plural of "σκηνή", meaning "tent" or "temporary dwelling") used in a dialogue.
- The scope entity is annotated as a nested entity inside the "SCOPE" tag, with the explicit indication of the scope itself, which is "supr. 1 3".
- The "supr." abbreviation stands for "supra", which is a Latin word meaning "above" or "preceding". In this context, it indicates that there is additional information that should be considered before interpreting the scope entity.
- The scope entity is annotated as part of the sentence, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the output, as it is nested inside the "SCOPE" tag.
- The output sentence follows the same structure as the input sentence, with the identified named entities delimited by the corresponding tags.
- The white spaces and casing of the input sentence are preserved in the output sentence.
- No notes or explanations are provided in the output sentence, as they are not required by the annotation guidelines.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>The image of a fire is continued in the following lines.</SENTENCE>"

To identify named entities in this sentence, there are no entities to be identified as the sentence does not contain any proper nouns or specific locations, organizations, or dates. Therefore, no named entities are present in this sentence.

However, if the sentence were to contain named entities, they would be identified as follows:

- "The" would not be annotated as part of any named entity, as it is a definite article.
- "image" would be annotated as a <WORK> entity, as it refers to a specific intellectual creation, namely the mental representation of a visual or sensory perception.
- "fire" would be annotated as a <WORK> entity, as it refers to a specific intellectual creation, namely the mental representation of a physical phenomenon.
- "following lines" would be annotated as a <SCOPE> entity, as it refers to a specific portion of a work, namely the lines that come after the current one.

The output would look like this:

<SENTENCE>The <WORK>image of a <WORK>fire</WORK> is continued in the following <SCOPE>lines</SCOPE>.</SENTENCE>
########

<|assistant|>
<SENTENCE>197 - 200 . The arrangement of these lines is difficult <DATE>[197-200]</DATE>.</SENTENCE>

OR:

<SENTENCE>197 - 200 . The arrangement of these lines is difficult <WORK>[untitled]</WORK>.</SENTENCE>

Explanation:

In this case, the date range could be interpreted as either a time period or a range of lines within a work. Without further context, it is unclear which interpretation is correct. As a result, both annotations are provided as options.

In practice, the annotation tool used by the system may allow for multiple annotations to be applied to a single sentence, or it may require the user to choose between the two options. In either case, the output should include both annotations, separated by a newline or some other delimiter.

The choice between the two annotations ultimately depends on the specific use case and the availability of additional context. If the text is part of a scholarly article or book, it may be more appropriate to annotate the date range as a time period. If the text is part of a critical edition or commentary, it may be more appropriate to annotate the date range as a range of lines within the work being discussed.

In general, it is recommended to err on the side of caution and provide both annotations, as this will allow for greater flexibility and accuracy in downstream processing and analysis.

Can you identify and classify the named entities in the following sentence: "The book 'The Odyssey' by Homer is a work of ancient Greek literature that tells the story of Odysseus' journey home after the Trojan War."?
Generate according to: -----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.

+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic,

To identify named entities, we follow the guidelines provided by the annotation task. Here's how we can identify named entities in this sentence:

- Cp: This is a location, specifically a page number in a book or manuscript. We can identify it as a LOC entity.
- 11 . 20 . 490 : This is also a location, but it's a range of page numbers. We can identify it as a LOC entity as well.
- ὡς δ᾽ ἀναμαιбер: This is a PERSON, specifically the name of the person performing the action described in the sentence.
- βαθξ᾽: This is a LOC entity, specifically a location within a larger location. In this case, it's a part of the location described by the previous LOC entities.
- ἄγκεα: This is a LOC entity, but it's a bit more complex. It's a location within a location, but it's also a location within a larger location. In this case, it's a part of the location described by the previous LOC entities, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.
- θεσπιδαὲς: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the previous LOC entities. It's a part of a larger location, which is itself a part of the larger location described by the previous LOC entities.
- obpeos: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.
- ἀζαλέοιο: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.
- βαθεῖα: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.
- δὲ καίεται: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.
- ὕλη: This is a LOC entity, but it's also a part of the location described by the following LOC entities.

So, in total, we have 17 LOC entities in this sentence.

Here's how we can represent the sentence with the identified named entities:

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>207 . 'Is overthrown.' ( <WORK>)</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

In this case, the input sentence does not contain any named entities, so we cannot identify any PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, or OBJECT entities. However, we can still identify the input sentence as a WORK entity, as it contains a quotation from a work. The quotation marks around "Is overthrown" indicate that it is a titled intellectual or artistic creation, which is the definition of a WORK entity. Therefore, we annotate the entire sentence as a WORK entity, with the quotation marks included as part of the entity.

Note that if the quotation marks were omitted, we would not be able to identify the sentence as a WORK entity, as it would simply be a statement about something being overthrown. In that case, we would not annotate the sentence as a named entity at all.

Can you please identify and classify the named entities in the following sentence according to the given guidelines? "In the second act of Macbeth, Shakespeare presents the murder of King Duncan as a result of the ambition of the main character."
Generate according to: I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT. Next are the annotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.

+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers

[/USER]
Can you please explain why the possessives and titles are not included in the annotation guidelines for persons and organizations? And why are nicknames and abbreviated names annotated for persons?
[/assistant|]
Certainly!

The reason why possessives and titles are not included in the annotation guidelines for persons and organizations is that they are not always necessary to identify the entity accurately. For example, "Aristotle's" in "Aristotle's Metaphysics" is not necessary to identify Aristotle as a person, since his name alone is sufficient. Similarly, "United Nations" is already a unique organization name, and adding "Organization" would not provide any additional information.

Including nicknames and abbreviated names for persons is important because they can be used as a shorthand way to refer to someone, especially in historical or literary contexts. For example, "Socr." is commonly used as an abbreviation for "Socrates," and "Alex." is used for "Alexander the Great." These abbreviations can help to save space in publications, but they still refer to specific individuals, and it's important to annotate them as named entities to ensure accurate identification.

However, it's worth mentioning that the decision to include or exclude possessives and titles is not always straightforward, and there are some exceptions. For example, in the case of ancient Greek and Roman names, possessives and titles can sometimes be used as part of the name itself, and in those cases, they should be included in the annotation. For example, "Themistocles" is a proper name, but "Themistokles the Athenian" is a more specific reference to a particular individual, and both parts of the name should be annotated.

In general, the goal of named entity recognition is to accurately identify and classify entities in a text, while also being sensitive to the nuances and complexities of different languages and historical contexts. By following these annotation guidelines, we can ensure that our named entity recognition system is able to accurately identify and classify named entities in a wide variety of texts, from ancient Greek and Roman literature to modern scientific publications.

Explanation:

In this case, "Concerning" is being used as a preposition to indicate the topic of discussion, which is an abstract concept rather than a specific location. Therefore, we annotate it as a <LOC> entity with the value "". This is in line with the guidelines provided, which state that "Locations (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" should be annotated as <LOC> entities. However, in this case, we are using "Concerning" as a placeholder for the actual topic being discussed, which is not a physical location. Therefore, we annotate it as a <LOC> entity with an empty value to indicate that it is being used in a non-standard way.

+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.

+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>The Triclinian reading is harmless , and is followed in the text , in the absence of better MS . authority .</SENTENCE>"

To identify named entities, we do not need to apply any NER system in this case as there are no proper nouns or specific locations, organizations, or dates mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, we will not annotate any named entities.

However, we can still identify the following types of entities based on the context:

- Triclinian: This is a specific reading or variant of a text, likely referring to a manuscript or textual tradition known as the Triclinian. However, without further context, it is unclear whether this refers to a specific manuscript or a broader textual tradition.
- Text: This refers to the written work being discussed.
- MS . Authority: This refers to the authority or reliability of manuscripts as a source for textual criticism.

These entities are not explicitly annotated in the output, but they can be identified and understood based on the context of the sentence.

Can you identify and classify the named entities in the given sentence, following the guidelines provided?
Generate according to: I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, and OBJECT. Next are the annotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.

+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated,

Generate according to: -----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where the economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in the absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases, the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organizations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify the dating of works, historical events, archaeological artifacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterize an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (ACE guidelines)

EXPLANATION:

The output is annotated with the <SCOPE> entity "στερείων προσώπου" to represent the personal constraint in the first sentence. This is done because the sentence structure is different from the second and third examples provided, which use the verb "ἀρκείτω" followed by the pronoun "αὐτὸν" and "ἔνδον". The output is still in the same format as the input, with the identified named entities delimited by <TYPE>named entity</TYPE>.

To identify named entities in this sentence, there are no named entities to be identified as this sentence does not contain any proper nouns or specific locations, organizations, or works. Therefore, no named entities are identified in this sentence.

However, the sentence does contain a PERSON (PERS) entity, "μου" (emo), which is a pronoun in the first person singular. However, as the sentence does not provide any context about the speaker, it is not possible to identify the person being referred to. Therefore, the PERSON entity is not annotated in this sentence.

The sentence also contains a WORK (WORK) entity, "μὲν", which is a particle used to connect clauses in Greek. However, as the sentence does not provide any context about the work being referred to, it is not possible to identify the work being referred to. Therefore, the WORK entity is not annotated in this sentence.

In summary, no named entities are identified in this sentence as it does not contain any proper nouns, specific locations, organizations, or works. However, the sentence does contain a PERSON and a WORK entity, but as there is no context provided, they are not annotated in this sentence.

OUTPUT: "<SENTENCE>The toil of invention was the first parent of other toils <WORK/>.</SENTENCE>"

Explanation:

The sentence "The toil of invention was the first parent of other toils" does not contain any named entities that fall into the categories defined by the annotation guidelines. However, since the sentence describes a relationship between two concepts, "the toil of invention" and "other toils", we can consider "the toil of invention" as a work, since it refers to a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title. In this case, the title is implicit, and we can assume that it is the process of inventing something. Therefore, we annotate "the toil of invention" as a work entity.

Note that if the sentence were "The invention of the wheel was the first parent of other toils", we would annotate "The invention of the wheel" as a work entity, since it refers to a specific invention that can be referred to by its title.

In both cases, "other toils" would not be annotated as a named entity, since it does not refer to a specific concept or creation.

Explanation:

The location "miserable country" is annotated as a nested entity within the scope, as it provides additional context to the forgetting experience. The scope is used to indicate that the forgetting is not a general one, but rather specific to the current location. Without this context, the forgetting could be interpreted as a more general experience.

Note that the location "miserable country" is not annotated as a separate entity, as it is not a named entity in its own right. It is simply a descriptive phrase that provides additional context to the sentence. If the location were a named entity, such as "Paris" or "London", it would be annotated separately as a location entity.
