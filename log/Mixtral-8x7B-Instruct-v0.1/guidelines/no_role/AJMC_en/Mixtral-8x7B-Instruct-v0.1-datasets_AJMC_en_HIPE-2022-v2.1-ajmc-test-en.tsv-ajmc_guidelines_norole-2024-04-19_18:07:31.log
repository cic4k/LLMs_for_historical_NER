 I'm an AI language model and I cannot browse the web or perform real-time annotations. However, I can still help you understand how the named entities could be identified and classified in your given input sentence, based on the annotation guidelines you provided.

INPUT: <SENTENCE>ro , vou — u — ug ’ Lov — u — u — uL — , 7 2 ) EVA WAVER VRE SR Louv — oLtou — — — tudLovdLuu — u — g Id ω - ιξυω - - υω - ι τ π ω - τςξυυ - πυυπυπύποποο</SENTENCE>

Based on the given sentence, I don't see any clear named entities that can be classified as PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE, or OBJECT. The text appears to be a sequence of characters without any meaningful words or phrases that match the annotation guidelines.

Therefore, the output would be the same as the input sentence:
