Note: The original text is from the trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735, and the text provided is a paraphrased version. The original text uses "spirit of the times" instead of "that spirit" and "this cause" instead of "this subject". However, based on the provided annotation guidelines, "spirit" should be annotated as an ORGANISATION (org) representing an abstract concept or idea, and "the times" or "this cause" should be annotated as a TIME (time) or a HUMAN PRODUCTION (prod) depending on the context. Since the context is not clear in the provided sentence, I assumed it to be a TIME (time) based on the given annotation guidelines. If the context is clearer in the original text, the annotation may need to be adjusted accordingly.

 This sentence appears to contain several errors and is difficult to understand due to its poor grammar and spelling mistakes. It also contains several non-annotated entities such as diseases and scientific terms. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately identify and classify the named entities in this sentence based on the given guidelines.

However, I can provide a possible interpretation of the sentence, which may help to identify some of the entities:

OUTPUT: <SENTENCE>Catarrhs, Asthmas, bore lit roads, and approaching Consumptions, A single trough of this named ciné will prove its rigorous quality in restoring a perception common to healthy people, it dislodges and excels the tough phlegm or mucus, thus striking at the root of the disease; the symptoms of common cold and cough are effectively treated and permanently conquered by this elegant and powerful <prod>pélation</prod>.</SENTENCE>

In this interpretation, the entities identified are:

* <prod>pélation</prod> (human production)
* Common cold and cough (non-annotated entities)

Note that this interpretation is based on the assumption that "ciné" refers to a type of human production, such as a medicine or therapy. If "ciné" has a different meaning, then the identified entities may be incorrect.

 This sentence appears to be written in an old or formal style, and it is difficult to determine the named entities without additional context. However, based on the provided text, it seems to contain several proper nouns that could be potential named entities: "Ut", "their decision", "the South", "you", "Day", "A A", "John I".

It is important to note that the sentence is not clear enough to determine the type of each named entity, as some of them could be organizations, persons, or locations. For example, "Ut" could be a person or an organization, and "the South" could refer to a geographical location or a political entity.

Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately identify and classify the named entities in this sentence according to the given guidelines.
