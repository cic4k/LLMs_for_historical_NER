The many places where the text of A omits a word or is corrupt, but where O supplies the omission and confirms L and the correct text, show that O certainly represents the text of an earlier date than A, when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which A has gathered.

Here, "A" and "O" refer to different versions of a text, with "O" being an earlier version that is considered more accurate and complete. "L" refers to a third version of the text that is also considered reliable. The sentence suggests that "O" is a better representation of the original text than "A", as it has fewer corruptions and errors.

Note: In this output, I have kept the original sentence as it is, without any changes.

However, I would like to point out that the sentence contains a few typos and grammatical errors. Here's a corrected version of the sentence:

"But, since there were two tents and two entrances, δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις: i.e., the literal sense is, ‘two doors of chiefs.’"

Note: δισσαῖς (dissais) is a rare word that means "double" or "twofold". δισσοστρατηγίσιν (dissostrategisin) is a compound word composed of δισσ- (diss-), a prefix meaning "double" or "twofold", and στρατηγίσιν (strategisin), a noun meaning "generalship" or "command". The phrase δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις (dissostrategisin pylis) means "double command" or "dual leadership".

  Yes, δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα could be interpreted as "a chariot belonging to two brothers".

In this phrase, δισσὰ (dissa) means "twofold" or "double", and ἀδελφῶν (adelphōn) means "of brothers". ἄρματα (armata) means "chariot".

So, the phrase δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα could be translated as "a chariot that belongs to two brothers".
