* "We" is a pronoun referring to the speaker or writer, and "good authority" is a common phrase used to indicate a reliable source, so neither of them needs to be tagged.
* "informed" is a verb, and "upon" is a preposition, so they don't need to be tagged either.
* "not uni ¬ form" is a negative phrase, and "prices" is a noun, so they don't need to be tagged.
