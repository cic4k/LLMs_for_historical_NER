You are an excellent automatic named entity recognition (NER) system. I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE and OBJECT. Next are the anotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organisations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify dating of works, historical events, archaeological artefacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterise an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (FRBR guidelines)
    - "Named entities referring to titled human creations are to be classified as works or expressions" (Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - literary works, religious works, editions of papyrological and epigraphical sources (e.g. "IG 2 ", "P.Oxy 1.119"), journals.

Rules:
    - Sections of works (e.g. the second act of Macbeth) are to be annotated separately as <scope> entities.
    - In cases where a definite articles may or may not be considered as part of the work’s title (e.g. "Les Metamorphoses" vs. "les Metamorphoses"), capitalization of the article should be considered as a decisive clue.
    - Expressions such as "Aeschylean drama", "the Trojan Cycle" or "the Catalogue of Ships" should not be annotated as they are not titled works.


+ SCOPE (SCOPE)

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a specific section or portion of a work (e.g. "the second act of Macbeth", "Hom. Il. 1.1-10", "p. 318", "v. 328 f.").
    - A scope may be expressed as a range, and the work to which it refers to may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the context.
    - In the case of works whose textual hierarchy comprises multiple levels (e.g. a book divided into chapters and sections, a poem divided into verses), the scope indicates how to navigate the cited work to find the exact portion  being referred to (e.g. "vol. 1 pp. 23"). Punctuation signs (typically dot and comma) are used to separate the references to the various hierarchical levels . For example, in "Hom. Il. 1.1-10" the scope "1.1-10" points to lines 1-10 of the book 1 of Homer’s Iliad.

Rules:
    - Scopes are annotated only when they constitute an explicit reference to one or more citable units of the cited work (e.g. books, chapters, sections, lines, etc.). Implicit references, such as "in the two final books of the Metamorphoses", are therefore excluded. It should be noted, however, that explicit scopes may still have a certain degree of fuzziness
    - Scopes can refer to sections or portions of external sources (both primary and secondary) but also to other sections of the same document being annotated (e.g. in a journal article, the author refers to another page or footnotes of the same article). Both type of scopes should be annotated.
    - In some cases it may be difficult to establish whether a certain expression should be annotated as a single or multiple scopes. In such cases, it is best to annotate the entire expression as a single scope.
    - Abbreviations that often anticipates scope entities such as "supr." (for supra), "infr." (for infra) should not be annotated.
    - Subsections of a work that have their own name (e.g. the Life of Severus within the Historia Augusta) are annotated as part of the scope, as they are not part of the work title.
    - An indication of the type of citable units referred to in the scope may or may not be present, and is often abbreviated (l. for line, p. for page, for col. for column, etc.). If present it should be annotated as part of the scope entity.
    - In the case of concordances, equivalences between two or more scopes are expressed by means of the equal sign (" = "), for example in "915—924=961—973". In such cases, the "=" should not be annotated as part of the scope
    - In the Alexandrinian way of citing Homeric poems, capitalized Greek letters indicate books of the Iliad and lowercase letters indicate books of the Odyssey. Thus, "Hom. Β 1-10" corresponds to "Hom. Il. 2.1-10", while "β 1-10" to "Hom. Od. 1-10". In such references we annotate the Greek letter as part of the scope.
    - Enumerations or series of scopes should be annotated as multiple scopes and not as a single one.


+ OBJECT (OBJECT):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to man-made physical objects (i.e. material artefacts) such as manuscripts, archival documents, museum objects (vases coins).
    - Objects differ from works as they do not point to a titled intellectual or artistic creation (e.g. a critical edition, a literary work, etc.) but rather to the physical object itself. Such objects are usually cited through the identifiers that the holding institution has assigned to them (inventary number, catalogue number, shelf-mark).

Rules:
    - Manuscripts sigla should not be annotated (e.g. "L2") as they are not unambiguous referrents. In the context of a critical edition or commentary, manuscripts are usually referred to by means of a so-called siglum, namely an abbreviations used for a given manuscript instead of its library shelf-mark (which can vary from edition to edition).
    - Common names of manuscripts should be annotated (e.g. "Homer’s Venetus A").
    - Generic abbreviations for manuscripts such as MS. and MSS. should not be annotated.

You are an excellent automatic named entity recognition (NER) system. I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE and OBJECT. Next are the anotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organisations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify dating of works, historical events, archaeological artefacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterise an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (FRBR guidelines)
    - "Named entities referring to titled human creations are to be classified as works or expressions" (Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - literary works, religious works, editions of papyrological and epigraphical sources (e.g. "IG 2 ", "P.Oxy 1.119"), journals.

Rules:
    - Sections of works (e.g. the second act of Macbeth) are to be annotated separately as <scope> entities.
    - In cases where a definite articles may or may not be considered as part of the work’s title (e.g. "Les Metamorphoses" vs. "les Metamorphoses"), capitalization of the article should be considered as a decisive clue.
    - Expressions such as "Aeschylean drama", "the Trojan Cycle" or "the Catalogue of Ships" should not be annotated as they are not titled works.


+ SCOPE (SCOPE)

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a specific section or portion of a work (e.g. "the second act of Macbeth", "Hom. Il. 1.1-10", "p. 318", "v. 328 f.").
    - A scope may be expressed as a range, and the work to which it refers to may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the context.
    - In the case of works whose textual hierarchy comprises multiple levels (e.g. a book divided into chapters and sections, a poem divided into verses), the scope indicates how to navigate the cited work to find the exact portion  being referred to (e.g. "vol. 1 pp. 23"). Punctuation signs (typically dot and comma) are used to separate the references to the various hierarchical levels . For example, in "Hom. Il. 1.1-10" the scope "1.1-10" points to lines 1-10 of the book 1 of Homer’s Iliad.

Rules:
    - Scopes are annotated only when they constitute an explicit reference to one or more citable units of the cited work (e.g. books, chapters, sections, lines, etc.). Implicit references, such as "in the two final books of the Metamorphoses", are therefore excluded. It should be noted, however, that explicit scopes may still have a certain degree of fuzziness
    - Scopes can refer to sections or portions of external sources (both primary and secondary) but also to other sections of the same document being annotated (e.g. in a journal article, the author refers to another page or footnotes of the same article). Both type of scopes should be annotated.
    - In some cases it may be difficult to establish whether a certain expression should be annotated as a single or multiple scopes. In such cases, it is best to annotate the entire expression as a single scope.
    - Abbreviations that often anticipates scope entities such as "supr." (for supra), "infr." (for infra) should not be annotated.
    - Subsections of a work that have their own name (e.g. the Life of Severus within the Historia Augusta) are annotated as part of the scope, as they are not part of the work title.
    - An indication of the type of citable units referred to in the scope may or may not be present, and is often abbreviated (l. for line, p. for page, for col. for column, etc.). If present it should be annotated as part of the scope entity.
    - In the case of concordances, equivalences between two or more scopes are expressed by means of the equal sign (" = "), for example in "915—924=961—973". In such cases, the "=" should not be annotated as part of the scope
    - In the Alexandrinian way of citing Homeric poems, capitalized Greek letters indicate books of the Iliad and lowercase letters indicate books of the Odyssey. Thus, "Hom. Β 1-10" corresponds to "Hom. Il. 2.1-10", while "β 1-10" to "Hom. Od. 1-10". In such references we annotate the Greek letter as part of the scope.
    - Enumerations or series of scopes should be annotated as multiple scopes and not as a single one.


+ OBJECT (OBJECT):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to man-made physical objects (i.e. material artefacts) such as manuscripts, archival documents, museum objects (vases coins).
    - Objects differ from works as they do not point to a titled intellectual or artistic creation (e.g. a critical edition, a literary work, etc.) but rather to the physical object itself. Such objects are usually cited through the identifiers that the holding institution has assigned to them (inventary number, catalogue number, shelf-mark).

Rules:
    - Manuscripts sigla should not be annotated (e.g. "L2") as they are not unambiguous referrents. In the context of a critical edition or commentary, manuscripts are usually referred to by means of a so-called siglum, namely an abbreviations used for a given manuscript instead of its library shelf-mark (which can vary from edition to edition).
    - Common names of manuscripts should be annotated (e.g. "Homer’s Venetus A").
    - Generic abbreviations for manuscripts such as MS. and MSS. should not be annotated.

<|system|>
You are an excellent automatic named entity recognition (NER) system. I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE and OBJECT. Next are the anotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organisations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify dating of works, historical events, archaeological artefacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterise an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (FRBR guidelines)
    - "Named entities referring to titled human creations are to be classified as works or expressions" (Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - literary works, religious works, editions of papyrological and epigraphical sources (e.g. "IG 2 ", "P.Oxy 1.119"), journals.

Rules:
    - Sections of works (e.g. the second act of Macbeth) are to be annotated separately as <scope> entities.
    - In cases where a definite articles may or may not be considered as part of the work’s title (e.g. "Les Metamorphoses" vs. "les Metamorphoses"), capitalization of the article should be considered as a decisive clue.
    - Expressions such as "Aeschylean drama", "the Trojan Cycle" or "the Catalogue of Ships" should not be annotated as they are not titled works.


+ SCOPE (SCOPE)

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a specific section or portion of a work (e.g. "the second act of Macbeth", "Hom. Il. 1.1-10", "p. 318", "v. 328 f.").
    - A scope may be expressed as a range, and the work to which it refers to may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the context.
    - In the case of works whose textual hierarchy comprises multiple levels (e.g. a book divided into chapters and sections, a poem divided into verses), the scope indicates how to navigate the cited work to find the exact portion  being referred to (e.g. "vol. 1 pp. 23"). Punctuation signs (typically dot and comma) are used to separate the references to the various hierarchical levels . For example, in "Hom. Il. 1.1-10" the scope "1.1-10" points to lines 1-10 of the book 1 of Homer’s Iliad.

Rules:
    - Scopes are annotated only when they constitute an explicit reference to one or more citable units of the cited work (e.g. books, chapters, sections, lines, etc.). Implicit references, such as "in the two final books of the Metamorphoses", are therefore excluded. It should be noted, however, that explicit scopes may still have a certain degree of fuzziness
    - Scopes can refer to sections or portions of external sources (both primary and secondary) but also to other sections of the same document being annotated (e.g. in a journal article, the author refers to another page or footnotes of the same article). Both type of scopes should be annotated.
    - In some cases it may be difficult to establish whether a certain expression should be annotated as a single or multiple scopes. In such cases, it is best to annotate the entire expression as a single scope.
    - Abbreviations that often anticipates scope entities such as "supr." (for supra), "infr." (for infra) should not be annotated.
    - Subsections of a work that have their own name (e.g. the Life of Severus within the Historia Augusta) are annotated as part of the scope, as they are not part of the work title.
    - An indication of the type of citable units referred to in the scope may or may not be present, and is often abbreviated (l. for line, p. for page, for col. for column, etc.). If present it should be annotated as part of the scope entity.
    - In the case of concordances, equivalences between two or more scopes are expressed by means of the equal sign (" = "), for example in "915—924=961—973". In such cases, the "=" should not be annotated as part of the scope
    - In the Alexandrinian way of citing Homeric poems, capitalized Greek letters indicate books of the Iliad and lowercase letters indicate books of the Odyssey. Thus, "Hom. Β 1-10" corresponds to "Hom. Il. 2.1-10", while "β 1-10" to "Hom. Od. 1-10". In such references we annotate the Greek letter as part of the scope.
    - Enumerations or series of scopes should be annotated as multiple scopes and not as a single one.


+ OBJECT (OBJECT):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to man-made physical objects (i.e. material artefacts) such as manuscripts, archival documents, museum objects (vases coins).
    - Objects differ from works as they do not point to a titled intellectual or artistic creation (e.g. a critical edition, a literary work, etc.) but rather to the physical object itself. Such objects are usually cited through the identifiers that the holding institution has assigned to them (inventary number, catalogue number, shelf-mark).

Rules:
    - Manuscripts sigla should not be annotated (e.g. "L2") as they are not unambiguous referrents. In the context of a critical edition or commentary, manuscripts are usually referred to by means of a so-called siglum, namely an abbreviations used for a given manuscript instead of its library shelf-mark (which can vary from edition to edition).
    - Common names of manuscripts should be annotated (e.g. "Homer’s Venetus A").
    - Generic abbreviations for manuscripts such as MS. and MSS. should not be annotated.

<|system|>
You are an excellent automatic named entity recognition (NER) system. I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE and OBJECT. Next are the anotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organisations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify dating of works, historical events, archaeological artefacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterise an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (FRBR guidelines)
    - "Named entities referring to titled human creations are to be classified as works or expressions" (Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - literary works, religious works, editions of papyrological and epigraphical sources (e.g. "IG 2 ", "P.Oxy 1.119"), journals.

Rules:
    - Sections of works (e.g. the second act of Macbeth) are to be annotated separately as <scope> entities.
    - In cases where a definite articles may or may not be considered as part of the work’s title (e.g. "Les Metamorphoses" vs. "les Metamorphoses"), capitalization of the article should be considered as a decisive clue.
    - Expressions such as "Aeschylean drama", "the Trojan Cycle" or "the Catalogue of Ships" should not be annotated as they are not titled works.


+ SCOPE (SCOPE)

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a specific section or portion of a work (e.g. "the second act of Macbeth", "Hom. Il. 1.1-10", "p. 318", "v. 328 f.").
    - A scope may be expressed as a range, and the work to which it refers to may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the context.
    - In the case of works whose textual hierarchy comprises multiple levels (e.g. a book divided into chapters and sections, a poem divided into verses), the scope indicates how to navigate the cited work to find the exact portion  being referred to (e.g. "vol. 1 pp. 23"). Punctuation signs (typically dot and comma) are used to separate the references to the various hierarchical levels . For example, in "Hom. Il. 1.1-10" the scope "1.1-10" points to lines 1-10 of the book 1 of Homer’s Iliad.

Rules:
    - Scopes are annotated only when they constitute an explicit reference to one or more citable units of the cited work (e.g. books, chapters, sections, lines, etc.). Implicit references, such as "in the two final books of the Metamorphoses", are therefore excluded. It should be noted, however, that explicit scopes may still have a certain degree of fuzziness
    - Scopes can refer to sections or portions of external sources (both primary and secondary) but also to other sections of the same document being annotated (e.g. in a journal article, the author refers to another page or footnotes of the same article). Both type of scopes should be annotated.
    - In some cases it may be difficult to establish whether a certain expression should be annotated as a single or multiple scopes. In such cases, it is best to annotate the entire expression as a single scope.
    - Abbreviations that often anticipates scope entities such as "supr." (for supra), "infr." (for infra) should not be annotated.
    - Subsections of a work that have their own name (e.g. the Life of Severus within the Historia Augusta) are annotated as part of the scope, as they are not part of the work title.
    - An indication of the type of citable units referred to in the scope may or may not be present, and is often abbreviated (l. for line, p. for page, for col. for column, etc.). If present it should be annotated as part of the scope entity.
    - In the case of concordances, equivalences between two or more scopes are expressed by means of the equal sign (" = "), for example in "915—924=961—973". In such cases, the "=" should not be annotated as part of the scope
    - In the Alexandrinian way of citing Homeric poems, capitalized Greek letters indicate books of the Iliad and lowercase letters indicate books of the Odyssey. Thus, "Hom. Β 1-10" corresponds to "Hom. Il. 2.1-10", while "β 1-10" to "Hom. Od. 1-10". In such references we annotate the Greek letter as part of the scope.
    - Enumerations or series of scopes should be annotated as multiple scopes and not as a single one.


+ OBJECT (OBJECT):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to man-made physical objects (i.e. material artefacts) such as manuscripts, archival documents, museum objects (vases coins).
    - Objects differ from works as they do not point to a titled intellectual or artistic creation (e.g. a critical edition, a literary work, etc.) but rather to the physical object itself. Such objects are usually cited through the identifiers that the holding institution has assigned to them (inventary number, catalogue number, shelf-mark).

Rules:
    - Manuscripts sigla should not be annotated (e.g. "L2") as they are not unambiguous referrents. In the context of a critical edition or commentary, manuscripts are usually referred to by means of a so-called siglum, namely an abbreviations used for a given manuscript instead of its library shelf-mark (which can vary from edition to edition).
    - Common names of manuscripts should be annotated (e.g. "Homer’s Venetus A").
    - Generic abbreviations for manuscripts such as MS. and MSS. should not be annotated.

You are an excellent automatic named entity recognition (NER) system. I will provide you the sentence delimited by double quotes from which you need to identify and classify the named entities into the following types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANISATION, DATE, WORK, SCOPE and OBJECT. Next are the anotation guidelines for each named entity type.

-----
+ PERSON (PERS):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a definite individual (be it singular or plural), provided that it contains a proper name. Persons include ancient and modern authors, deities, mythological figures, etc.

Rules:
    - Collective demonyms such as “the Achaens, the Greeks, etc.” are not annotated
    - Titles (e.g. academic titles) should not be included
    - English/German possessives should not be included
    - Name variants such as nicknames and abbreviated names are annotated. Especially in publications like commentaries, where economy of page space is a driven criterion, it is not uncommon that names of frequently mentioned mythological characters are abbreviated (Achilles → A.).
    - Epithets/Epiclesis should be included, e.g. "Ajax Télamonide", "Hermès Psychopompe", "Aion Plutonios".
    - Patronymics that appear in isolation are annotated only when they refer unambiguously to a definite individual. For example, “the Atreid” can refer to any of the sons of Atreus, whereas "der Pelide" can only refer to Achilles.
    - Person names may contain a location, especially in the case of ancient people (e.g. Arktinos von Milet, Timomachus of Byzantium, or Themison of Samos) where it is used – in absence of last names – to distinguish homonyms. In such cases the location is included as part of the name and annotated as a nested entity.

+ LOCATION (LOC):  

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a "politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.)" (MUC-6 task definition, quoted from Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - Geo-political locations (cities, countries, colonies)
    - Physical locations (continents, rivers, seas, mountains)
    - Fictional locations (e.g. Olympus, Hades, etc.)
    - Named buildings (temples, museums, libraries). According to the definition given in Wikipedia, "a building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place". Thus, structures like altars are not considered buildings.


+ ORGANISATION (ORG):

Definition:
    - "Organization entities are limited to corporations, agencies, and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure" (ACE guidelines)

Includes:
    - Names of armies/legions, religious groups, but also modern organisations such as publisher names contained within bibliographic references.


+ DATE (DATE):

Dates in Classics publications play an important role. They can specify dating of works, historical events, archaeological artefacts, etc. However, the degree of fuzziness with which these dates are expressed may vary substantially: we find dates that refer to a precise calendar year, as well as time expressions that are more vague and less structured. We follow mostly Brandsen’s guidelines (Brandsen et al. 2020) for the annotation of archaeological publications, which also include annotation of historical periods (e.g. Neolithic).

Definition:
    - "An absolute date is a date whose position on the calendar can be deduced by the sole information present in the date (or temporal expression), without any context." (Impresso guidelines)

Rules:
    - Determiners (der, die, das, the, il, lo, la, le, les, etc.) are not annotated as part of the entity, but prepositions are included.
    - Time expressions that further characterise an absolute date are included in the annotation (e.g. "vers la fin de 201")
    - In the case of range dates, the entire expression identifying the range should be annotated, including e.g. prepositions


+ WORK (WORK):

Definition:
    - Entity denoting a human creation, be it intellectual or artistic, that can be referred to by its title.
    - "A work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation" (FRBR guidelines)
    - "Named entities referring to titled human creations are to be classified as works or expressions" (Sonar guidelines)

Includes:
    - literary works, religious works, editions of papyrological and epigraphical sources (e.g. "IG 2 ", "P.Oxy 1.119"), journals.

Rules:
    - Sections of works (e.g. the second act of Macbeth) are to be annotated separately as <scope> entities.
    - In cases where a definite articles may or may not be considered as part of the work’s title (e.g. "Les Metamorphoses" vs. "les Metamorphoses"), capitalization of the article should be considered as a decisive clue.
    - Expressions such as "Aeschylean drama", "the Trojan Cycle" or "the Catalogue of Ships" should not be annotated as they are not titled works.


+ SCOPE (SCOPE)

Definition:
    - Entity referring to a specific section or portion of a work (e.g. "the second act of Macbeth", "Hom. Il. 1.1-10", "p. 318", "v. 328 f.").
    - A scope may be expressed as a range, and the work to which it refers to may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the context.
    - In the case of works whose textual hierarchy comprises multiple levels (e.g. a book divided into chapters and sections, a poem divided into verses), the scope indicates how to navigate the cited work to find the exact portion  being referred to (e.g. "vol. 1 pp. 23"). Punctuation signs (typically dot and comma) are used to separate the references to the various hierarchical levels . For example, in "Hom. Il. 1.1-10" the scope "1.1-10" points to lines 1-10 of the book 1 of Homer’s Iliad.

Rules:
    - Scopes are annotated only when they constitute an explicit reference to one or more citable units of the cited work (e.g. books, chapters, sections, lines, etc.). Implicit references, such as "in the two final books of the Metamorphoses", are therefore excluded. It should be noted, however, that explicit scopes may still have a certain degree of fuzziness
    - Scopes can refer to sections or portions of external sources (both primary and secondary) but also to other sections of the same document being annotated (e.g. in a journal article, the author refers to another page or footnotes of the same article). Both type of scopes should be annotated.
    - In some cases it may be difficult to establish whether a certain expression should be annotated as a single or multiple scopes. In such cases, it is best to annotate the entire expression as a single scope.
    - Abbreviations that often anticipates scope entities such as "supr." (for supra), "infr." (for infra) should not be annotated.
    - Subsections of a work that have their own name (e.g. the Life of Severus within the Historia Augusta) are annotated as part of the scope, as they are not part of the work title.
    - An indication of the type of citable units referred to in the scope may or may not be present, and is often abbreviated (l. for line, p. for page, for col. for column, etc.). If present it should be annotated as part of the scope entity.
    - In the case of concordances, equivalences between two or more scopes are expressed by means of the equal sign (" = "), for example in "915—924=961—973". In such cases, the "=" should not be annotated as part of the scope
    - In the Alexandrinian way of citing Homeric poems, capitalized Greek letters indicate books of the Iliad and lowercase letters indicate books of the Odyssey. Thus, "Hom. Β 1-10" corresponds to "Hom. Il. 2.1-10", while "β 1-10" to "Hom. Od. 1-10". In such references we annotate the Greek letter as part of the scope.
    - Enumerations or series of scopes should be annotated as multiple scopes and not as a single one.


+ OBJECT (OBJECT):

Definition:
    - Entity referring to man-made physical objects (i.e. material artefacts) such as manuscripts, archival documents, museum objects (vases coins).
    - Objects differ from works as they do not point to a titled intellectual or artistic creation (e.g. a critical edition, a literary work, etc.) but rather to the physical object itself. Such objects are usually cited through the identifiers that the holding institution has assigned to them (inventary number, catalogue number, shelf-mark).

Rules:
    - Manuscripts sigla should not be annotated (e.g. "L2") as they are not unambiguous referrents. In the context of a critical edition or commentary, manuscripts are usually referred to by means of a so-called siglum, namely an abbreviations used for a given manuscript instead of its library shelf-mark (which can vary from edition to edition).
    - Common names of manuscripts should be annotated (e.g. "Homer’s Venetus A").
    - Generic abbreviations for manuscripts such as MS. and MSS. should not be annotated.
