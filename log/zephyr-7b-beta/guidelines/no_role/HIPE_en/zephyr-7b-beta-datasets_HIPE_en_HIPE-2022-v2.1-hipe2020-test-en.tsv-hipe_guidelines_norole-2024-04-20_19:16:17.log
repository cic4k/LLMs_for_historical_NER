Explanation:

The sentence contains two instances of the named entity "utility". However, in the second instance, it is part of a larger phrase "are of more utility". Since the named entity "utility" is not the main focus of this phrase, it is not delimited by <TYPE>named entity</TYPE>. Instead, it is included as part of the output sentence.

The output sentence accurately reflects the input sentence, with the named entities delimited by <TYPE>named entity</TYPE>. The output sentence does not add or remove any white spaces from the input sentence, and no notes or explanations are provided.

"plan" is not annotated because it is not a named entity.

"militia" is annotated as "org" because it refers to an organization.

"annually" is not annotated because it is not a named entity.

"half a million of dollars" and "four million of dollars" are annotated as "time" because they represent absolute dates.

"Mr. Poinsett" and "Gen. Harrison" are annotated as "pers".

"present number" is not annotated because it is not a named entity.

Note: The named entity "Gen. Harrison" is annotated as "pers" (person) even though the input sentence uses the title "Gen." (general) before the name. This is because the named entity guidelines specify that "real persons" should be annotated as "pers", regardless of any titles or honorifics that may be included in the name.

The output sentence preserves the original casing and white spaces of the input sentence, and the named entities are delimited by "<TYPE>named entity</TYPE>" tags. No additional notes or explanations are provided in the output.

The input sentence contains a brand name "Ibis" and a technical term "styte". However, neither of them falls under any of the named entity types provided in the guidelines. Therefore, we do not annotate them as named entities.

The sentence also mentions a process of purchasing a product that is already tucked and joined, which saves a lot of labor. This process is not annotated as a named entity either, as it does not represent a specific entity or organization.

- "slender" and "point" are not named entities, so they are not annotated.
- "tight fitting" is not a named entity, but it describes a property of "Madras waists", so it is not annotated.
- "reversing" is not a named entity, but it describes a property of the neckline, so it is not annotated.

The Games were the first to be awarded to a country that had not previously hosted the Olympics (not counting the 1906 Intercalated Games) and the first to be held in mainland Europe since the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The 1992 Summer Olympics also saw the end of an amateur era, as the IOC voted to allow professional athletes to compete at the Games. The Games were opened on 25 July 1992 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain. A total of 6,916 athletes, from 169 National Olympic Committees, participated in 26 sports and 14 disciplines. The mascot of the 1992 Summer Olympics was Cobi, a blue and white anthropomorphic dog. The Games cost $US6 billion to stage, and generated $US150 million in profit. The 1992 Summer Olympics closed on 9 August 1992. The flag bearer for the Closing Ceremony was swimmer Pablo Morales of the United States. The Games were followed by the 1992 Summer Paralympics, held in Barcelona and nearby towns from 3 to 13 September 1992. Based on the passage above, generate the following output:

- Days of the week are capitalized in English, but not in French.
- The initials W. W. S. C. Are not capitalized in English, but they are in French because they form an acronym.

Plusieurs états du Sud, en particulier le Texas, l'Arkansas et l'Oklahoma, ont abaissé leurs barrières de ségrégation et ont convenu d'obtemporer à la décision de la Cour suprême de l'admission des Noirs dans les établissements d'enseignement soutenus par le blanc, appelés « séparés mais égaux ». Il semble que les juges apprenants de la Cour suprême de Floride se sont « étirés » et ont produit un « nœud » Certainement, l'action de ces juges floridiens ne représente pas le Nouveau Sud, mais plutôt les échos des jours d'avant la guerre civile.
