SIR , <we>WE have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to <prod>translate</prod> effec ¬ tual Amendments to the <org>Constitution of the United States</org> , and it is with grief that we now <prod>propose</prod> inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments , and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our country .
By perusing the Journal of the Senate , your Excellency will fee , that we did , in vain , bring to view the Amendments propofed by our <org>Convention</org> , and approv ed by the <org>Legislature</org> .

We have the honor , of every ( entiment of <pers>rc - fpeCt</pers> , to be , Sir , your Excellency ’ s moft obedient , and very humble fervants , <pers>RICHARD HENRY LEE WILLIAM GRAYSON</pers> .
PRESIDENT <pers>Sullivan</pers>'s MESSAGE .
To the Hon .
Senate and House <org>Representatives</org> , <loc>New Hampshire</loc> . Gentlemen , <pers>Having been informed</pers> , that doubts have arisen in the minds of some, whether my having accepted the office of <org>District Judge</org> has not disqualified me from acting as <PERSON>President of the State</PERSON> , until a new election takes place , I confess that I have never been able to discover any incompatibility in the two offices .
But as some have attempted to prove this by urging the words of a <org>Constitution</org> framed for the purpose of <org>New Hampshire</org> - blifting over the people of <loc>New Hampshire</loc> a free, sovereign and independent government — <pers>one</pers> observes, that this government has [ nicely been changed by the voice of the people, who have agreed that their safety depended on their relinquishing many of the powers retained by the people in that Constitution, to a General Government established for the people of each and every State who would adopt it; which to them became the general law of the land .
The people of this <loc>State</loc> did , in the moff folemn manner , a dipt <event>ratify</event> that <prod>Constitution</prod> ; and from that e - vent , this ceased to be a free , sovereign , andindependent <loc>state</loc> ; and upon my being elcdled to the office of <pers>President</pers> , I was only fworn to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as <pers>President</pers> of a free and confederate <loc>State</loc> ; and I was at or near the fame time fworn to fupport the <org>Confederation</org> union of the United States , by virtue of a law enacted by yourfelves .
I was appointed under that <doc:Constitution>Constitution</doc:Constitution> which the people of <loc>New Hampffiire</loc> had adopted for themselves , a Judge of the Federal Court .
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the people , and could not devife a way of re - figning the truft committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it .
I well knew that the time for electing a new <pers>Prefident</pers> was near at hand , when the people might have an opportunity of declaring who <should>prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been entrusted to my care , and the affairs of the State unfolded to me , I could not , without an unpardonable breach of trust , neglect to lay them before you .
I also considered, that while I was living in the State, no other <pers>person</pers> could, by your own laws, administer the necessary oaths to you to qualify you as <org>Legislators</org>, while the time for which I was chosen was not expired; and as I knew that this would probably be the last session of this Court, for the present year; and I had no inclination to propose myself as a candidate for another — I concluded that delicacy would have prevented some <pers>persons</pers> from pursuing the methods they have adopted, for gratifying a spirit which ought never to lodge itself in the branch of a <org>Legislature</org>.
Gentlemen , You will feel the situation I am in , and may easily conceive of my feelings upon this <time>subject</time> , being brought forward , at every opportunity , to fa ’ - tate that <org>spirit</org> which has often , before this <loc>Court</loc> , displayed itself before me , and used every effort against me .
The <pers>Prefident</pers> and <pers>Senate</pers> of the United States were , at the time of my appointment , well acqainted with my having to finish my year in presiding over this <loc>State</loc> ; but no hint has ever been given to me of my acceptance of an office under the present <org>general government</org> , rendering void any <loc>State</loc> appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often , fince my acceptance of the office of <org>Distridl Judge</org> for <loc>New - Hampfttire</loc> , in company with the <pers>Prefident</pers> of the United States , who knew I was the <pers>Prefident</pers> of this <loc>State</loc> , and treated me as such , although he at the same time knew that I had long before accepted the office of <org>Federal Judge</org> .
I know the candour and justice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightness to suppose, that they will suffer themselves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more, who cannot avoid at every opportunity, discovering the spirit which alters them in their conduct .
I have the honour , & c

The official account of the capture of <ENTITY>Bruffels</ENTITY> , is as under .
It is dated the <time>12th of December</time> .
" At length , notwithstanding the armifiice , and every other pretence , <pers>joo brave Patriots of Brufiels</pers> have dared to engage in battle with <pers>6poo Aullrains</pers> .
The action commenced <time>yesterday afternoon</time> , at four o ’ clock .
The firft attenpt was.tp make prifoners of all the <pers>soldiers</pers> who guarded the <org>Mint</org> , and thofe who were quartered in the different <loc>convents</loc> .
General D ’ <pers>Alton</pers> did his tu ¬ rnoff from <time>fix o ’ clock in the morning</time> to negotiate an <org>armistice</org> .
About <time>even o ’ clock</time> , <num>8co</num> men of <loc>Benden</loc> entered the city with two pieces of <prod>cannon</prod> , which they planted on the <loc>Grand Pa ¬ lace</loc> .
About ten o ’ clock <pers>General D ’ Alton</pers> thought proper to fend a large <time>dctatchment</time> in order to releafe, by forcible means, the <pers>officers and privates</pers> made prisoners in <loc>Bafleville</loc> .
This was the signal for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its victory .
The Patriots no longer able to contain themselves , routed the whole <org>detachment</org> .
To the number of <pers>Joo</pers> , at the utmost , they invaded the great market , and after a modest conflict , they made them masters of the <org>Coros de Garde</org> , and took control of 400 <pers>Austrians</pers> prisoners .
About the <time>fame time</time> the engagement re-commenced in all quarters of the city ; and , in <loc>lefs than two hours</loc> , the Patriots made themselves matter of the <org>barracks of the military</org> and of the magazines , in which they found near 2,000 <prod>muskets</prod> , besides cartridges , ammunition , &c .
To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the <loc>Park</loc> and the <loc>Pal ¬ ace Royale</loc> , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or <prod>cannon</prod> .
After a very heavy firing on both <org>sides</org> , <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> perceiving that the place was no longer tenable against so much bravery , capitulated for the immediate retreat of his whole <org>garrison</org> ; and the requisition having been acceded to , about one <time>o’ clock</time> they departed , with great precipitation , through the <loc>Porte de Namur</loc> .
But as not all the <pers>foldieis</pers> are equally inclined to follow <pers>hinj</pers> , at the moment this is writing , they are <action>quabbling</action> among themselves , without the city .
Already , we have got more than 3,000 <pers>prisoners</pers> ; but a few <pers>killed</pers> , and no <loc>houses</loc> plundered .
For the Gazstte of the Unites States , i Letter I . TO <pers>Thomas Jefferson</pers> , Vice President of the Unites States .
!
States , Philad : <time>July 3 , 1800</time> .
AS you are a candidate for the <org>Supreme Magistracy</org> of the United States , a knowledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country .
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in politi <org>concerns</org> , I would not have troubled you <pers>Sir</pers> with these setters , since your <pers>vices</pers> or your <pers>virtues</pers> could have had but little relation to our <loc>national happiness</loc> ; — You might then , <pers>Sir</pers> , have <loc>Aided down</loc> the current of <org>use</org> in obscurity , and at least have had the consolation to know that your <pers>deformities</pers> were hidden from the <loc>world</loc> .
But , as , <pers>Sir</pers> , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the <org>Presidency</org> , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your <loc>country</loc> may perhaps confide her dearest interest to .
It is my duty , as it is my <pers>wife</pers> , to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess , and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered <org>America</org> in the course of a long life busied with public cares , — - But , Sir , it is also my duty to speak of those other qualities of your <pers>heart and mind</pers> which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country .
Nature , Sir , in profusion , gifted you with talents , a brilliant fancy , penetrating <pers>genius</pers> and a native elegance of diction , combined with a thirst for knowledge , formed a man of <pers>lea rung</pers> and taste , well acquainted with the classics , deeply read in the philosophy of natural history , observant of men and things , and attentive in theory to political concerns .
But , to balance tin fe <pers>singular favors</pers> , <he>stie</he> denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great nation , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable .
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your mind is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your closet you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of <loc>Nature</loc> ; but the fatigues, perseverance and firm <pers>Mnper</pers>, nectssiry in an <org>Executive station</org> , would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occasions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened understanding useless to its possessor and injurious to his country .
Let me conjure you, <pers>Sir</pers> , to call to your remembrance the history of your political life , and from a regard to your peace and reputation , not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the <org>Presidency</org> .
You have been , Sir , a <pers>Governor</pers> , an <pers>Ambassador</pers> , and a <pers>Secretary of State</pers> , and had to desert each of these posts , from that weakness of nerves , want of fortitude and total imbecility of character , which have marked your whole <prod>political career</prod> , and most probably will at ¬ tend you to your grave .
Remember , Sir , , all the services you <pers>have rendered</pers> your <org>country</org> were of the literary kind—The <doc>Declaration of Independence</doc> was penned in <loc>your closet</loc> , where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that <doc>Declaration</doc> by any extraordinary exercise , or by exposing yourself to any immediate danger .
When <pers>Governor of Virginia</pers> , you sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appointment by <org>Congress</org> .
A ; the danger was visi-ble , you acted consistently with your chr-racter , but surely did not display either much firmness or patriotism .
But , Sir , weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are <PERSON>natal defects</PERSON>—they are not faults of your own—tho ’ were you , <PERSON>conscious</PERSON> of your <PERSON>defects</PERSON> , to accept the <ORGANISATION>important office</ORGANISATION> of President , when the <LOCATION>liberty</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>rights</LOCATION> of millions and the <LOCATION>happiness</LOCATION> of your <LOCATION>country</LOCATION> are depending , it would <TIME>amount to a crime</TIME> .
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the head of a <org>party</org> devoted to the enemies of <org>America</org> , and a <org>party</org> created for her ruin .

From a letter received in this place from a <pers>gentleman of intelligence</pers> , and from our exchange papers which come to us from different sections of the country , we have the utmost assurance in saying that the <org>Indian cause</org> is gaining ground .
There is a great excitement on this <prod>subject</prod> and this excitement is extending .
Meetings have been held in <loc>New York</loc> , <loc>Philadelphia</loc> , <loc>New Haven</loc> and <loc>Hartford</loc> , and memorials to Congress adopted—other meetings will be held in other places .
From the abstract of the debate in the House of Representatives , on the question of referring the New York memorial to the <org>Committee on Indian Affairs</org> , which our readers will find in another part of our paper , there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of <org>Congress</org> ,
Washington , <time>January 25 , 1830</time> - Gentlemen .
Your letter of the <time>I8ih</time> has been received .
We feel highly gratified to learn , that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable <org>meeting in New - York</org> , against the violation of ’ <org>he treaties</org> with the Cherokee and other <org>nations of Indians</org> , meets your approval .
In vindicating the sacred right of the citizen to petition <org>government</org> on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respectable meeting of our fellow citizens , on a subject involving the faith of the <loc>nation</loc> , its honor and character ; and the existence of a race of men .
now the remnant of a <org>powerful nation</org> ; we did no more than perform a duty ■ incumbent on us .
as the representatives of a free people .
We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration , of what we said on the interesting <event>occasion</event> to which you refer .
We are , most respectfully , Your obedient servants , <pers>A SPENCER HENRY R . STORRS</pers> .

It is sup BY-posited that the decent members will not at  BY-attempt business until the rowdies have ex  BY-hausted themselves—or the House been purged after a general knock down and drag out .
There has as yet been no bloodshed , except a little scratching and hair pulling in the lobby .
The Senate has done some business , has passed the Sub - <org>Sub-Treasury Bill</org> , and seems inclined to be decent , though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock up the sand scene ’ good as you sir , ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir , ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — afiiiir between <pers>Messrs . Clay</pers> and <pers>Walker</pers> other day - Why will 31 <pers>r</pers>.
Clay disturb the harmony of the Senate , and rutile ( lie even current of his unaspiring course by such discordant scrapes ?
From the <org>Otmndagiia ( N . A . )</org> Standard .
The plan for disciplining the militia , proposed by <pers>Mr . poinsett</pers> , would cost only half a million of dollars annually ; while that proposed by <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> , with the present number of our militia , would cost about <num>FOUR MILLIONS</num> of dollars annually .
Gen. <pers>Harrison</pers> proposed to place the whole force , brought under discipline on his system , distinctly within the control of <org>President</org> .
On the <time>3d of February last</time> , <pers>Gen. Ilarrisou</pers> addressed a letter to the <org>" Louisville Legion "</org> , in which he mentioned the plan <pers>here</pers> brought to view as one of his principal efforts to improve the discipline of the militia .
And furthermore , <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> ' s keepers have assured the public , that his sentiments have undergone <time>no change</time> .
Of course , then , <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official <org>statiou</org> , if placed in the Presidential chair , the odious and oppressively burthen - some <prod>scheme proposed by him</prod> to Congress .
Now , when the Western State Journal <org>announces</org> Gen.<pers>Harrison</pers> <time>plan</time> for organizing the militia , the world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , and which has never received <pers>Mr . Yan</pers>' approval .

From the <loc>Pennsylvanian</loc> .
Harrisburg , <time>June 26 , 1S40</time> .
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the <date>17th iust</date> .
, as well as another <time>letter of similar import</time> , dated <time>16th inst</time> .
, tender <pers>I</pers> a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you , just on the eve of my <time>deparure</time> from Philadelphia .
It is a matter of regret to me , that <time>time</time> , and my other indispensable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered hospitality ; Allow me to return my warmest thanks for the “ <org>high regard and esteem</org> ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meritorious services .
" I cannot , and I ought not to suppose , that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have distinguished the history of <org>Pennsylvania</org> since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her <loc>government</loc> , every official act I may find it necessary to perform , and every recommendation I may feel called on to make , should meet with unanimous approval ."
It would be as unreasonable as it would be vain to look for this .
Some of the questions that have agitated <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> , and required my action upon them , are among the most intricate and perplexed in the whole science of government , aud have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion , in the minds of the wisest and best men in this , aud other countries .
How , then , can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours , where habit , feeling , interest and intelligence are so variously di <loc>diversified</loc> and combined in their influence upon different individuals ?
At the time when the executive functions of Pennsylvania passed into my hands , I found them beset with difficulties on all sides .
An overwhelming public debt—the interest <time>seeni annually falling due upon it</time>—a stupendous system of public improvements disjointed and unfinished—a banking system , <org>involving an enormous amount of incorporated capital</org> , directly or indirectly connected with the most ofthe business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details <prod>indubitable proofs of its usuriousness and imperfection</prod>—the banking institutions struggling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprises paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended , and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow , without knowing <time>wheii it would fall</time> , or on what portion with the greatest weight .
Such was some of the embarrassments encountered at the outset of my <org>official career</org> , and the worst evils they portended have been fully realized .
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise , and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the people , according to my solemn <prod>convictions</prod> of out ) ' , and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost responsibility of my station .
1 assert no claim to infallibility or judgment , or to a share ef wisdom superior to others , but to undeviating <pers>houesty of purpose</pers> I do avow that I have a <prod>title</prod> , of which no human power can deprive me .
Forming part of the Executive, but a portion of the Legislative power of this commonwealth, he is often reduced to the unavoidable necessity, of sanctioning measures which do not in all respects meet his approval, or to prevent, by refusing such sauetiou, any legislation on the subject at all .
I have found myself in several dilemmas, where my only choice was between the two evils of an imperfect <law>law</law> , and no <prod>legislativе action</prod> whatever .
Iu such cases I have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none , and have generally yielded my assent , even though I had objections to some parts of the <org>law</org> .
7 ’ he lato resolutions providing for the time of resuming specie payments by the <org>batiks</org> was one of this description .
I thought at the time and still think that the day fixed was too remote , but I believed the permanent interests of the community required that a day should be designated as speedily as possible for that event , and if it was not so grossly unreasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the time uncertain and indefinite , I should not prevent it becoming a law .
It was , moreover , a subject on which the Legislature had deliberated for months , and the ' fixing the precise day on which it should take place , being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle , a decent respect for the opinions of the people ’ s <org>représentatives</org> , a majority of whom , in both branches , were elected by men of my own <pers>political faith</pers> , seemed to forbid the propriety of <org>interposin</org> ' * the negative power , with which the constitution had clothed the Executive .
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best , in whatever aspect it could be viewed .
Accord dans notre gouvernement, la législation est une affaire de compromise sur des objets.
No one <pers>co-ordinateur de département</pers> has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar <prodd:doctrine>sentiments</prodd:doctrine> , on the part of the others .
All that either can do , is to take care that none of its essential <principles of constitutional construction</principles> or <principles of public policy</principles> shall be violated by the others ; when that is done , the remaining circle of duties can be performed in a spirit of <humans-production>mutual concession and compromise</humans-production> .
This is the doctrine of the <doctrine>constitution</doctrine> , the voice of the people , and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the government in harmony and goodwill .
7 ’ his principle affords the explanation of my approval of more measures than one , against portions of which I had objections ; but it is the only pretext on which the Legislature has refused or omitted to sanction recommendatjous of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this commonwealth .
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the <org>Legislature</org> on this subject , and it is of the public to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the <org>Legislature</org> , or that body right in refusing to adopt them .
I am gratified, however, in this, that <pers>I</pers> most of the views embodied in <pers>my recommendations</pers>, the majority of the House of <org>Representatives</org> coincided with me in opinion, and a number of <pers>Democratic members of the Senate</pers> .
They failed , however , of <prod>success</prod> , and the remedy is in the hands of the people , if they approve of those measures , at the <time>next election</time> .
If they do not , whatever consequen ¬ ces follow , I have done my duty .
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this commonwealth , it will be found , I think , that though much has been left undone , « great deal has been accomplished ».
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements , sustaining the faith and credit of the <org>state</org> , and terminating the present disastrous suspension of specie payments , with provision which secures the public against like recurrence in future , under a forfeiture of their charters by the <org>banks</org> ; and so far as depends on me , will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced .
7 ' he improvement bill , it is univer ¬ sally admitted , coutains less objectionable matter than can be fouud in any prior legis ¬ lation on that subject .
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance <time>that the long practiced system of log - rolling</system> , which has impoverished our treasury to the amount of some millions , is at an end .
7 <pers>he</pers> precise nature of the difficulties we have labored under , in achieving this much , can only be learned by those who examine with care and caudor into our real condition .
All the pecuniary responsibilities , as well as the resources of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> , must be taken into account , in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued .
YY ’ e must take things as they are .
YY ' e cannot retrieve what was done by our <pers>predecessors</pers> ; and those who expect us to <org>fact</org> as if <org>Pencj-lnnia</org> had no <prod>public debt</prod> to provide for , unfinished improvements to complete , no <org>public interests</org> to be protected , betray an ignorance of our true situation that entitles either the <org>censure</org> or their praise to very little regard .
7 ' he is favorable of those , who , like the gentlemen I address , are familiar with the true interests of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> , is a gratifying encouragement to the public man .
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed , those who understand what the best interests of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them .
Even though those endeavors should not in all minute respects correspond with their own <pers>personal sentiments</pers> .
Differing iu mere matters of detail , I feel convinced that <org>Iu all the great principles of public policy , the democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> entertains but one fun ¬ damental system of opinion .
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good <org>government</org> .
Recent experience has confirmed this opinion , and assured me that <time>time</time> and <time>experience</time> are the great champions of the democratic cause .
I trust the recent <time>aud embarrassments</time> of our situation and the means to obviate them , will clearly illustrate this truth .
I am certain that <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> , surrounded as she has been by diffi culties on all hands , will be soon extricated , — that all evils complained of will be corrected , — abuses reformed , - — her contracts fulfilled , and every duty of government be faithfully performed , without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> has ever held dear .
Please accept , gentlemen , for yourselves individually , the assurauce of my high regard and consideration .

Dear Sir : The promiueut attitude which you now occupy in relation to the <org>coining Residential contest</org> , confers upon every voter in this widely extended Republic , however humble may be his condition , a right to inquire your views upon each one of those momentous questions which now agitate the public mind .
Prompted , not by an impertinent curiosity , but solely by a desire to ascertaining , whether your views or those of <pers>General Harrison</pers> coincide more nearly with our own , we are induced to propound to you the following questions , viz
: 1 . <pers>AY</pers> you , it <pers>re-elected President</pers> , veto any bill having for its object , the abolition of slavery in the <loc>District of Columbia</loc> ; or would you sanction any bill granting appropriations <prod>public money</prod> , to any <org>State</org> , soliciting aid for the emancipation of <pers>their slaves</pers> ?
2. Do you think that, at this time, the safety of the public money requires a re-chartering of the <org>United States Bank</org> ; or would you sign a bill chartering such an institution ?
3 . Are you in favor of preserving entire the <org>Tariff Compromise</org>
?
4 . <pers>YA</pers> would you sanction any bill granting appropriations of the public money , for the purposes of internal improvement , by means of <prod>canals , railroads , $ ; c</prod> .
I 5 . Do you approve of <pers>N Ir Poinsett</pers>' s scheme for the organization of the militia ?
J he preceding questions have been proposed to <pers>Nlr Harrison</pers> .

THE HEW COUNTY BRIDGE AND <loc>School</loc> , <loc>House</loc> .
Le nouveau pont comté sur le James river , juste au sud de la ville , est terminé et prêt pour la fréquentation publique .
Its entire length is 160 <length>leet</length> , and its substruction is built of 12x12 <length>timbers</timbers> , with a covering 16 <length>leet</length> wide , made of 7 inch <length>plank</plank> , with a railing 3 feet <length>high</high> on each side .
The bridge was constructed by <pers>Peter Auberton</pers> of this city .
Mr . <pers>Auberton</pers> also took the <prod>contract</prod> for building the <loc>village school house</loc> for this place , which he expects to have done by the <time>first of February</time> .

The height from the top of the flag staff on the cupola to the ground is <time>62 feet high</time> .
The structure is in every way first class , and cost about $<money>3000</money> .
' Mr . <pers>Auberton</pers> a fait beaucoup de travail pour le comté de Stutsman , ayant construit la maison de justice au début de l'automne , et nous comprenons que son travail a ainsi fait jusqu'ici une satisfaction entière .
A Bit oT Daring .
A Western paper tells the story of <pers>Steve Venard</pers>'s fight with three <pers>robbers</pers> in <time>1866</time> .
The stage coming to <loc>Nevada</loc> , Col.
, had been robbed by three men , and the <prod>treasure box</prod> taken .
A party set out for its recovery .
Yenard , armed with a <prod>Henry rifle</prod> , followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rugged region .
The hills hung steep above .
The waters of the ravine came tumbling down its steep <loc>bed of bowl ¬ ders</loc> with a rush and a noise which rendered no other sounds audible .
Yenard attempted to cross the <loc>stream at the head of the fall</loc> .
He walked on a short <loc>log</loc> to a <loc>rock</loc> .
Above him rose the huge mass of <loc>granite</loc> , buttressed in front by two smaller <loc>rocks</loc> .
Between these latter was an alley which led to the <loc>base of the Titan</loc> .
His position was <unannotated>suen</unannotated> as to look up the alley .
At the base of the great rock <loc>Yenard</loc> discovered the leader of the gang sitting on the ground drawing his <prod>revolver</prod> .
Venard leveled his rifle upon the <pers>robber</pers> , twenty feet distant .
At the same time he saw an <pers>other of the gang</pers> pointing at him over the edge of a <loc>rock</loc> .
There was no time to change his aim .
He fired ; the leader fell back , shot through the heart .
The other robber attempted to shield himself farther behind a <loc>rock</loc> , leaving the point of his <prod>pistol</prod> exposed over the top .
Venard covered the spot with his unerring <weapon>Henry</weapon> , and when the head of the robber peered over the top, <pers>his</pers> brain was pierced with a bullet .
There was yet another , but he was not to be seen .
His pistol might at that mo ment be pointing at <pers>Yenard</pers> .
The latter clambered up to beard him in his <loc>den</loc> .
He found the <prod>treasure</prod> , took the <prod>pistols</prod> from the dead , covered quickly the former with <loc>earth</loc> and <loc>leaves</loc> , and proceeded to hunt the <pers>missing robber</pers> .
He found him running up the <loc>mountain</loc> , sixty yards or more ahead .
Ve <pers>Venard</pers> fired and the robber fell .
Another bullet , and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead .
TUB SCHOOL BOARD : <org>Just what our school board</org> propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear , but it ia safe to predict that no <pers>lady teacher</pers> will get the school .
The majority of the <org>board</org> are very much opposed to such an arrangement , and so long as they are <pers>our people</pers> have but little to fear from them in that direction .
W <pers>believe</pers> that the board <org>desire</org> to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the people .
Mr . Lees , as well as Mr . McKechnie , stated to us not long since , that they would not in any degree favor the installation of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests of the people .
We do not oppose the hiring of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> because we are particularly prejudiced against them , for we are not , and believe that some of the most reliable and able teachers that bless our land to - day are <pers>ladies</pers> .
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present , and we are of the opinion that we cannot , could a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , with no more than ordinary ability do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the county will agree with us when we answer most emphatically , no .
If our county was able to stand the extra expense we would be In favor of hiring <quantity>two teachers</quantity> instead of one .
Could we see our way clear in this direction we would then favor the engagement of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department , leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the hands of a capable <pers>gentle man teacher</pers> .
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against <pers>Mrs . Shoe ¬ maker</pers> , and in that account are opposed to her being engaged is basely false .
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately , in regard to <pers>Mrs . Shoemaker</pers> which would in any way convey the idea that we are personally prejudiced against her .
We are not in favor of her teaching the school for the same reasons that we would oppose any other <pers>lady teacher</pers> who might be endeavoring to get it .
A little over a year ago the <org>Sturgeon</org> <pers>Lendcr</pers> published a very sensational account of the marriage of <pers>Miss Nettie White</pers> to <pers>Robert</pers> .
<pers>L . Winn</pers> .
Miss White. <time>at the time</time> , was engaged to both <pers>Chas</pers> .
and Robt .
Winn , <pers>two brothers</pers> , but had much difficulty in deciding which of her <pers>lovers</pers> was the <prod>wbichest</prod> .
Robt .
, however , proved to be the successful suitor .
The young couple recently agreed to dis <NE>agree</NE> , and the faithless <NE>Robert</NE> .
left for <loc>Texas</loc> , and the young wife returned to the home of her <pers>parents</pers> , and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant <pers>spouse</pers> upon the <reason>grounds</reason> of desertion .
The prospects for a re-hearing for the <pers>disconsolate Charles</pers> , who has spent the intervening time in repining , are growing very bright , as the young lady now declares that she really loved <pers>Charles</pers> best in the first place .
The firm of <org>Geo</org> .
D . Barnard <org>Isr Co</org> , of St . Louis , is a firm which some officials in this county give a great many orders for <prod>letter beads , envelopes and such other blanks</prod> , <loc>in this county</loc> , are all Republicans , but <pers>Mr . Keene</pers> , their traveling sales <job>man</job> in this territory , we understand , is a Democrat .
We have been in <pers>informed</pers> , upon good authority , that <org>Messrs . Barnard & Co</org> are not <prod>uni-form</prod> in their prices .
For instance , ' un certain livre blanc connu vendre dans le comté de Montgomery pour 17 $ .
In St . Charles county they place “ un tarif ” of SI ' , on the same book , and in Lincoln county the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from ’’ $21 for the very same book .
We presume their prices are made in proportion to the number of pocket <prod>knives , gold pens , etc .</prod> , they give away to capture an order .
If <org>Democratic</org> county of <org>officials</org> will send their orders abroad for job work , let them , at least , patronize <org>Democratic</org> firms .
Curiosities of the Postage Stamp .
There are about 6,000 varieties of postage stamps now in use by the <org>different nations</org> of the world .
The museum of the <org>Berlin post</org> - contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens , half of which are European and the remainder is divided between <loc>America</loc> , <loc>Asia</loc> , <loc>Africa</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc> .
The emblems upon the stamps of <org>nations</org> are legion ; the earth , the sea and the vaulted canopy above have been ransacked for curious and mraning less devices and legends .
The en tire animal kingdom , the stars and the moon in all its phases , besides legendary emblems by the thousand , are known to the <org>collectors of stamps</org> , who pride themselves upon being “ <prod>philatelists</prod> ”.
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be found the names of <pers>five emperors</pers> , <num>eighteen</num> kings , <num>three</num> queens , one <title>grand duke</title> , several <title>inferior titled rulers</title> and many <title>presidents</title> .
M . <pers>Pliillippe de Ferrari</pers> perhaps has the largest and most valuable collection of stamps in the world , amounting to something like <quantity>2ft0,000</quantity> , and within the present year he sold one little stamp to a collector in <loc>Paris</loc> for <quantity>150.000</quantity> .
In England and other parts of Europe , horseshoes are now in use , made of <prod>cowhide</prod> instead of <prod>iron</prod> .
The shoe is composed of three thick <prod>hide</prod>s which is pressed into a solid steel <org>mould</org> and after <time>ward</time> treated by a chemical process .
It is said to be far superior , in several particulars , to the <prod>iron shoe</prod> .

The Shirt Waist .
Very inviting are the displays of <org>Ox ¬ fords</org> , <org>cheviots</org> , <org>zephyrs</org> and <org>madras cloths</org> for the shirt waist , and the made-up models have already pushed out of place their winter representaives in <org>cloth</org> , <org>velvet</org> and <org>fine llannels</org> .
We shall wear the comfortable wools , aye , and even buy them for some time to come , but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the <prod>thinner successeurs</prod> .
A pretty feature in the wash <loc>waist</loc> for next summer is their <prod>simplicity</prod> .
The human form divine is to have a chance to breathe once more , for the <prod>voluminous starchy fronts</prod> are no more .
Even those professing to be loose have no surplus material , and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain , fitted over <loc>shoulders</loc> and bust and buttoned simply down the <loc>back</loc> .
Red dotted swiss has the entire front crossed In diamonds ^ of white val insertion , the undarted front Just puck ¬ ered a little at the belt , the plain back closed with bullet - shaped pearl buttons .
The close sleeves have a tight <org>cult</org> , and the simple , unlined col <loc>lar</loc> has little oblong turnovers of <org>Swiss</org> and <org>Valenciennes</org> <prod>lace</prod> .
Another style for these buttou - up - the - back waists Is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting .

Madras waists , aiso have a slender - rest of tucking , running down to a point at the <loc>waist</loc> , and have little re - vers from the neck to the <loc>bust</loc> on each side .
These are also of tucking and simply finished with a frill of narrow lace .
Large collars and full , fussy re - vers are not shown at all .
There is every evidence that the <time>1900 summer</time> girl proposes , above all , to be sweetly cleanly .
Her waists say plainly enough that it will be a simple matter to wash and Iron them , and there need be no lack In their number for that reason .
One feature which marks them ns new and far prettier than the old shirt waists is the entire absence of yokes of any kind , even In the back .
The only semblance of a yoke is the one which is trimmed and applied to the shoulders , forming a little <loc>epaulet</loc> over the sleeves .
The backs of the semi <prod>front waists</prod> are tucked and plaited to correspond with the front .
There are stiff linen cuffs , with rounded corners and detachable collars , which can be discarded altogether for the more becoming <prod>stocks</prod> , and long <prod>silk scarfs</prod> tied twice around the neck .
The campaign will take place in New York and Chicago.

FOREIGN WORDS .

There are , on the other hand , <pers>ninny words</pers> that do not readily lend themselves to the English style of pronunciation , or that are not used often enough to warrant it .
In pro <org>announcing</org> such words the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the foreign languages .
In Latin, two vowels are not put In one syllable unless they are joined as a <prod>diphthong</prod> .
There are as many syl <prod>syllables</prod> as there are vowels in a word .
( Si ' - ne di ' - e for sine die . » In German , the letter <org>W</org> has the sound of <org>v</org> in English . ( <org>Vahg ' - ner</org> for <org>Wagner</org> .
Ceci est vrai en français également, mais w n'est trouvé que dans des mots empruntés à d'autres langues .
The letter i in German and in the Latin tongues, <lang>viz : French , Italian and Spanish</lang>, <time>lias</time> the sound of long e .
( Peek for pique , Fr . : Bee ' - an - ko for Bianco , It . ; I > ee ' - os for Dios , Sp . )
In the Latin tongues , also , the letter <loc>a</loc> generally , though not always has the broad sound , while the letter <loc>o</loc> has the long sound .
Tlie letter c in I tali : n when fol ¬ followed by e or i 1ms the sound of eh .
( Viu ' - cliee for Vinci )
Final consonants in French are nearly always silent .
( Pah for Pas . )
So also is final e silent unless , an accent mark is placed above it .
The aecentiMl e has the sound of long a in English or a sound quite close to that .
The syllables in French words are never accented as in English words .
All of them are supposed to receive equal emphasis , but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into <loc>the next word</loc> .
The French make frequent use of nasal vowels , so-called , the correct pronunciation of which is <prod>difficult to acquire</prod> .
The nasal vowel is composed of a vowel and a consonant—<prod>m</prod> or <prod>n</prod> .
The consonant is practically silent , but serves to give the nasal tone to the vowel .
The pronunciation of the word <word>salon</word> , ( for example ) as given in Web  Stanley's dictionary .
Is sa - loug ' .
It should be observed that in the front of <org>dietionary</org> it is explicitly stated that this <prod>ng</prod> is silent , being used only to convey the idea of tin <time>nasal sound</time> .

Why does Great Britain buy its oatmeal from us ?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to speak of exjxirt - ing <org>Quaker Oats Company</org> oatmeal to Scotland and yet , every year the <org>Quaker Oats Company</org> sends hundreds of thousands of cases of Quaker Oats to <country>Great Britain</country> and Europe , <time>The reason is simple</time> ; while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically , and active mentally of all people , the American has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade .
How well he has succeeded would be seen at a glance at the export <org>reports on Quaker Oats</org> .

CRIMSON CLOVER <I had a short article in last week ’ s <org>Herald</org> on the importance of crimson clover , and I have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil .
Now .
I am not acquainted with all the farmers who have grown crimson clover <loc>Putnam county</loc> and I wish I was .
I would have a great many more short articles published , but to any one who has grown this crop and feels like recommending it to his farmer friends please write a short piece and send to me or <org>the Herald</org> with your name signed , so we can see who has had the experience .
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of crimson clover : First , prepare - the <loc>seed bed</loc> well .
Make the seed / bed as for <prod>wheat or clover</prod> and sow 15 to 20 lbs .
of <loc>se6d</loc> to the acre and if there has not been other clover grown on the land recently, inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise, inoculation should be applied .
.
Either get some soil from <loc>clover field</loc> or get the liquid inocula <prod>inoculation</prod> and inoculate the seed before sowing , but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the bright <time>sunlight</time> .
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in <loc>the shade</loc> to dry and then sow in the early morning or in the evening or on <TIME>.
a cloudy day with the <prod>harrow following the seeding</prod> .
In this way the inoculation is <prod>effective</prod> .
Apply when seeding <prod>cromson clover</prod> some 15 per cent <prod>acid phosphate</prod> from 100 to 300 pounds to the acre .
In this way the clover gets a good growth and the better the clover grows the more nitrogen it gathers and stores in .
the soil , consequently the better crop you get following the <prod>crimson clover</prod> .
* If you are sowinf for a pas ¬ ture and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of rye with the crimson clover .
It will finish more pasture and help to hold the clover .
Hoping to see your testimony of growing <prod>crimson clover</prod> in the paper next week , if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow , let us hear from you .

CLEARING UP THE EDENTON CENSUS COUNT <org>Edentonians</org> have berm raising quite a squawk over the census re <time>returns</time> , They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their duties , that the <org>carriers</org> beak ; cf the <org>Edcnton pnsloff.ee</org> shows that the <org>poslofficc</org> serves approximately 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they are clamoiing for a new enumeration .
In the efTia * of the District Supervisor of Census , this is cla .

Edentonians have been boasting ‘ for several years that the population of their town was more than 5,000 <time>J</time> when the official count revealed only 3,519 ; Edentonians were disappointed and began to grumble. Several suspicious busybodies, anxious to boost the population of their town, borrowed the carrier’s books from the postoffice and counted all the names therein. They found nearly 4,500 names in the books. And immediately a cry was raised: ‘ We want, a new tabulation. There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us.
Bui it was just so much hokum , in the opinion of a <pers>representative</pers> of the District Supervisor ' s office ; If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edenton ' s population is ever the 4.000 mark , they didn ' t succeed in fooling anyone else ; When a person or a family moves to a town , the name is placed in the <org>carrier's</org> bock ; But . when they leave town , their names are not struck off the bocks ; Edentonians even wanted to in - ' elude in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians ' working away from Edenton , but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by Uncle Gam ; So the official census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519 . Edentonians ’ protests to the conti aiy notwithstanding .

The opinion stated that the plan to provide <time>temporary arrangement</time> at the white institutions until “ adequate and comparative facilities are offered at the Ne - gro institution” meets all requirements of the <org>federal law</org> , and that the temporary arrangement “conforms as nearly as it can with due regard to the paramount federal law” , with the long established policy of the <org>state of Florida</org> that there shall be a system of segregation of the races in the state schools, but that <org>impartial provisions</org> shall be made for the schools for <pers>white</pers> and <pers>Negro</pers> schools alike .
There is no greater farce than the diabolically “ <org>separet but equal</org> ” system in educational institutions and public carriers, of which the Southland adheres to so tenaciously .
