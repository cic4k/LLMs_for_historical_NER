In all the cases given <SCOPE>above</SCOPE> , except one or two which are specified , <ENTITY>O</ENTITY> has preserved the correct reading , and almost invariably sides with <ENTITY>L</ENTITY> against <ENTITY>A</ENTITY> .

The list of differences just given , in almost all of which <PERS>O</PERS> corrects <PERS>A</PERS>'s errors , clearly shows <PERS>A</PERS>'s tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to <PERS>A</PERS>'s family , but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of <PERS>O</PERS>'s original .
The many places where the text of <WORK>A</WORK> omits a word or is corrupt , but where <WORK>O</WORK> supplies the omission and confirms <WORK>L</WORK> and the correct text , show that <WORK>O</WORK> certainly represents the text of an earlier date than <WORK>A</WORK> , when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which <WORK>A</WORK> has gathered .

28 <OBJECT>τρανές</OBJECT> , ‘clear , ’ like the cognate <WORK>τορόν</WORK> ( rt . <WORK>τερ</WORK> , <WORK>τρα</WORK> , <WORK>τε</WORK> - <WORK>τραίνω</WORK> , to pierce ) .
The adj . <WORK>τρανής</WORK> is not elsewhere extant . but <WORK>τρανῶς</WORK> is used by <PERS>Aesch.</PERS> ( <WORK>Ag.</WORK> <SCOPE>1371</SCOPE> ) and <PERS>Eur.</PERS> ( <WORK>El.</WORK> <SCOPE>758</SCOPE> ) .
The form τρανός was current in later <DATE>Greek ( c . 25 B . C . )</DATE> ; the earliest instance seems to be <PERS>Dionys . Halic .</PERS>
De <WORK>Comp . Verborum</WORK> c . 22 τρανὴν καὶ καθαρὰν δύναμιν . ἀλώμεθα : this fig . sense , with ref . to uncertainty ‘to be at sea , ’ as we say ) , belongs nowhere else to this verb , but often to <WORK>πλανᾶσθαι</WORK> ( <WORK>Her . 6 . 37</WORK> , etc . ; <WORK>Plat . Hipp . Ma . 304 C</WORK> <PERS>πλανὼμοι</PERS> μὲν καὶ ἀπορῷ ἀεί ) .
24 θελοντής . The form <PERS>ἐθελοντής</PERS> occurs in <PERS>Herodotus</PERS> , <PERS>Thucydides</PERS> , <PERS>Xenophon</PERS>, and the <WORK>Orators</WORK> , as <PERS>ἐθελοντήρ</PERS> does in <WORK>Od .</WORK> <SCOPE>2 . 292</SCOPE> .
On the other hand <PERS>θελοντής</PERS> is cited only from <PERS>Porphyrius</PERS> ( c . 270 A . D . , see <PERS>Lobeck</PERS> , <WORK>Phrym .</WORK> 7 ) and <PERS>Hierocles</PERS> ( c . 450 A . D . ) , ἄρ . <WORK>Slob .</WORK> <SCOPE>For . 75 . 14</SCOPE> ( p . 449 . 20 ) .
Similarly <PERS>Plato</PERS> ( <WORK>Crat .</WORK> <SCOPE>406 A</SCOPE> ) , while the earliest authority for <WORD>θελήμων</WORD> is <PERS>Apoll .</PERS> <WORK>Rhod .</WORK> <SCOPE>2 . 557</SCOPE> .
In <WORK>ragio iambics</WORK> θέλω was naturally preferred , on metrical grounds , to ἐθέλω , though the latter occurs in tragic anapaests ( as <WORK>O . T .</WORK> 1303 , <WORK>Ph .</WORK> 145 ) .
If <WORK>θελοντής</WORK> were found in a pasage where metre reguiredit , the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection .
But where , as here , <SCOPE>aphaeresis</SCOPE> was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote <WORD>ἐθελοντής</WORD> . — <WORD>ὑπεῖύγην</WORD> , as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself : cp . <WORK>P .</WORK> <SCOPE>1025</SCOPE> <WORD>κλοπῇ</WORD> τε κἀνάγκη ξυγείς ( <SCOPE>n .</SCOPE> )

From the cognate form <WORK>κατεναίρομαι</WORK> we have <WORK>κατήναρὲς</WORK> in <WORK>Anmi</WORK> . <SCOPE>871</SCOPE> . - ἐς χερὸς , by a human hand .
The military sense , ‘at close quarters ’ ( <PERS>Ten . H .</PERS> <WORK>7 . 2 . 14</WORK> ἐνέβαλὸν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἐμάχοντο ) , is less fitting here .
- αὐτοῖς ποιμνίον ἐπιστάταις ; <WORK>cp</WORK> . <WORK>fr</WORK> . <SCOPE>873</SCOPE> αὐτοῖσιν ὅπλοις .
The idiom occurs in the <WORK>Iliad</WORK> ( as <SCOPE>8 . 24</SCOPE> ) , — sometimes with συν added ( as <WORK>14 . 498</WORK> ) , a form of it found also , though not often , in later poetry ( <PERS>Eur .</PERS> <WORK>Ion</WORK> 32 αὐτ ’ ξὺν ἄγγει ) . — <WORK>ἐπιστάταῖς</WORK> , ‘overseers , ’ masters ’ or ‘guardians ’ of them ; as a warrior is <WORK>ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης</WORK> ( <PERS>Aesch .</PERS> <WORK>Prs .</WORK> 379 ) , and a rower , <WORK>ἐρετμῶν</WORK> ( <PERS>Eur .</PERS> <WORK>Helen .</WORK> 1267 ) .

Common rumour at once pointed to <PERS>Ajax</PERS> .
Then the <WORK>ὀπτήρ</WORK> ( <SCOPE>29</SCOPE> ) informed <PERS>Odysseus</PERS> , who reached the tent of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> very soon after the tatters return ; as is shown by <SCOPE>296 - 304</SCOPE> compared with

The phrase is equivalent , of course , to <WORK>δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις</WORK> .
721 <WORK>στρατήγιον</WORK> , <SCOPE>n .</SCOPE>
But , since there were two tents and two <SCOPE>entrances</SCOPE> , δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i . e . , the literal sense is , ‘two doors of chiefs . ”
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent , so that only one entrance could be meant by <WORK>πύλαις</WORK> , then , indeed , <WORK>δισσαῖς</WORK> could be explained only as reforring to the subst . implied in <WORK>στρατηγίσιν</WORK> , “ the tent - door of two chiefs , ’ = <WORK>δισσοστρατηγίσιν</WORK> <WORK>πύλαις</WORK> .
But such a use of <WORD>δισσαῖς</WORD> seems impossible .
