FROM <org>Virginia Paper</org>.
To his EXCELLENCY the <pers>Governor Ginia</pers>.
<time>NEW YORK</time>, <time>SEPT . 28</time> , <time>1780</time> .
SIR , WE have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to <time>translate effective Amendments</time> to the <org>Constitution of the United States</org> , and it is with grief that we now <org>propose</org> inadequate <HumanProd>propositions</HumanProd> inadequate to the purpofe of real and <time>substantial Amendments</time> , and <time>so far short</time> of the <time>wishes</time> of our country .
By perusing the Journal of the Senate , your Excellency will fee , that we did , in vain , bring to view the Amendments propofed by our <org>Convention</org> , and approv ¬ ed by the Legiflature .
We fltall tranfmit a com <loc>complete let</loc> of the Journals of both <org>Houfes of Con</org> to your addrefs , which with a letter accom panying them , we entreat your Excellency will have the gaodnefs to lay before the Honorable <org>Legillature</org> of the enfuing meeting .
We have the honor, of every ( <pers>entiment of rc - fpeCt</pers> , to be, Sir, your Excellency’s most obedient, and very humble <pers>fervants</pers> ) , <pers>Richard Henry Lee Williams Grayson</pers> .
PRESIDENT <pers>Sullivan</pers> ’ s MESSAGE .
To the Hon .
Senate and House <org>Representatives</org> , [ 0 / New - Hampshire ] <pers>Gentlemen</pers> , <pers>Having been informed</pers> , that doubts have arisen in the minds of some, whether my having accepted the office of <org>District Judge</org> has not disqualified me from acting as <org>President of the State</org> , until a new election takes place , I confess that I have never been able to discover any incompatibility in the two offices .
But as some have attempted to prove this by urging the words of a<PROD>Constitution</PROD> framed for the purpose of <ORG>New Hampshire</ORG> - blifting over the people of <LOC>New Hampshire</LOC> a free, sovereign and independent government — <PERS>one</PERS> may observe, that this<PROD>government</PROD> has [ nicely been changed by the voice of the people, who have agreed that their <PROD>safety</PROD> depended on their relinquishing many of the powers retained by the people in that <PROD>Constitution</PROD>, to a General <ORG>Government</ORG> established for the people of each and every <LOC>State</LOC> who would adopt it; which to them became the general law of the land.
The people of this <loc>State</loc> did , in the <time>moff folemn manner</time> , a <humanprod>dipt</humanprod> and <humanprod>ratify</humanprod> that <time>Constitution</time> ; and from that <time>event</time> , this ceased to be a free , <pers>sovereign</pers> , and <pers>independent</pers> state ; and upon my being <pers>elcdled</pers> to the office of <pers>Prefident</pers> , I was only <humanprod>fworn</humanprod> to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as <pers>Prefident</pers> of a free and confederate <loc>State</loc> ; and I was at or near the <time>same time</time> <humanprod>fworn</humanprod> to <humanprod>support</humanprod> the <org>Confederation</org> of the United States , by virtue of a <humanprod>law</humanprod> enacted by your<pers>selves</pers> .
I was appointed under that <doc:Constitution>Constitution</doc:Constitution> which the people of <loc>New Hampffiire</loc> had adopted for themselves , a <doc:Judge>Judge</doc:Judge> of the Federal Court .
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the people , and could not devife a way of re - figning the truft committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it .
I well knew that the time for electing a new <PERS>Prefident</PERS> was near at hand , when the people might have an opportunity of declaring who <PERS>should</PERS> preside over them ; and all the public papers having been entrusted to my care , and the affairs of the State unfolded to me , I could not , without an unpardonable breach of trust , neglect to lay them before you .
I also considered, that while I was living in the State, no other <pers>person</pers> could, by your own laws, administer the necessary oaths to you to qualify you as <org>Legislators</org>, while the time for which I was chosen was not expired; and as I knew that this would probably be the last session of this Court, for the present year; and I had no inclination to propose myself as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have prevented some <pers>persons</pers> from pursuing the methods they have adopted, for gratifying a spirit which ought never to lodge itself in the branch of a <org>Legislature</org>.
Gentlemen, You will feel the situation I am in, and may easily conceive of my feelings upon this subject, being brought forward, at every opportunity, to <pers>facilitate</pers> that <pers>spirit</pers> which has often, before this <org>Court</org>, displayed itself before me, and used every effort against me.
The Prefident and Senate of the United States were, at the time of my appointment, well acquainted with my having to finish my year in presiding over this State; but no hint has ever been given to me of my acceptance of an office under the present general government, rendering void any State appointment; even though I have had the honor of being often, since my acceptance of the office of District Judge for New - Hampshire, in company with the President of the United States, who knew I was the President of this State, and treated me as such, although he at the same time knew that I had long before accepted the office of Federal Judge.
I know the candour and justice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightness to suppose, that they will suffer themselves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more, who cannot avoid at every opportunity, discovering the spirit which alters them in their conduct.
I have the honour , & c .

The official account of the capture of <pers>Bruffels</pers> pnbliflied by the Patriots , is as under .
It is dated <time>the 12th of December</time> .
" At length , notwithstanding the armifiice , and every other pretence , <pers>joo brave Patriots of Brufiels</pers> have dared to engage in battle with <num>6poo Aullrains</num> .
The action commenced <time>yesterday</time> <time>afternoon</time> , at four o ’ <time>clock</time> .
The firft attenpt was.tp make prifoners of all the <pers>soldiers</pers> who guarded the <org>Mint</org> , and thofe who were quartered in the different <loc>convents</loc> .
General D ’ <pers>Alton</pers> did his tu ¬ rmoff from <time>fix o ’ clock in the morning</time> to negotiate an <org>armistice</org> .
About ( even o ’ clock , <time>8co</time> men of Benden - D ’ <loc>Aloft</loc> entered the city with two pieces of cannon , which they planted on the <loc>Grand Pa ¬ lace</loc> .
About ten o ’ clock <time>General D ’ Alton</pers> thought proper to fend a large <humanProd>detchment</humanProd> in order to releafe, by forcible means, the <pers>officers</pers> and <pers>privates</pers> made <loc>prifoners</loc> in <loc>Bafleville</loc> .
This was the fignal for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its victory .
The Patriots no longer able to contain themselves , routed the whole <org>detachment</org> .
To the number of <num>joo</num> , at the utmost , they invaded the great market , and after a modest conflict , they made them <org>masters of the Coros de Garde</org> , and took obotlt <num>400</num> Austrian prisoners .
About the <time>fame time</time> the engagement re - commenced in all quarters<loc>of the city</loc> ; and , in <time>less than two hours</time> , the Patriots made themselves matter of the <org>barracks of the military</org> and<loc>of the magazines</loc> , in which they found near 2,000 <HumanProd>muskets</HumanProd> , besides cartridges , ammunition , & c .
To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the <loc>Park</loc> and the <loc>Pal ¬ ace Royale</loc> , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or <humanProd>cannon</humanProd> .
After a very heavy firing on both <org>sides</org> , <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> perceiving that the place was no longer tenable against so much bravery , capitulated for the immediate retreat of his whole <org>garrison</org> ; and the requisition having been acceded to , about one <time>o’ clock</time> they departed , with great precipitation , through the <loc>Porte de Namur</loc> .
But as all the <pers>foldieis</pers> are not equally inclined to follow <pers>hinj</pers> , at the moment this is writing , they are <time>fquabbling among themselves</time> , without the city .
Already , we have got more than 3,000 <pers>prisoners</pers> ; but a few <pers>killed</pers> , and no <loc>houses</loc> plundered .
For the Gazstte of the Unites States , i Letter I . TO <pers>Thomas Jefferson</pers> , Vice President of the Unites States .

States, Philad : <time>July 3, 1800</time> .
AS you are a candidate for the Supreme <org>Magistracy</org> of the United States , a knowledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country .
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in political concerns, I would not have troubled you <time>in the public</time> with these settlers, since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then, Sir, have <loc>hidden down</loc> the current of <org>Use</org> in obscurity, and at least have had the consolation to know that your deformities were <loc>hidden from the world</loc> .
But , as , <pers>Sir</pers> , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the <time>Presidency</time> , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your <org>country</org> may perhaps confide her dearest interest to .
It is my duty, as it is my <pers>wiffi</pers>, to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess, and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered America in the course of a long life busied with public cares, — - But, Sir, it is also my duty to speak of those other qualities of your <pers>heart and mind</pers> which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country.
Nature, Sir, in profusion, gifted you with talents, a brilliant fancy, penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction, combined with a thirst for knowledge, formed a man of <pers>learning and taste</pers>, well acquainted with the classics, deeply read in the philosophy of natural history, observant of men and things, and attentive in theory to <org>political concerns</org>.
But , to balance tin fe singular favors , stie denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great nation , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable .
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your <pers>mind</pers> is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your <loc>closet</loc> you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of Nature ; but the <time>fatigues</time> , perseverance and firm <pers>Mnper</pers> , nectssiry in an <org>Executive</org> station , would wear out the remains of those delicate <pers>nerves</pers> which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened <pers>understanding</pers> useless to its possessor and injurious to his country .
Let me conjure you, Sir, to call to your remembrance the history of your <pers>political life</pers> , and from a regard to your peace and reputation, not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the <org>Presidency</org> .
You have been, Sir, a <pers>Governor</pers>, an <org>Ambassador</org>, and a <pers>Secretary of State</pers>, and had to desert each of these posts, from that weakness of nerves, want of fortitude and total imbecility of character, which have marked your whole <pers>political career</pers>, and most probably will <time>attract</time> you to your grave .
Remember, Sir, , all the services you<pers>evei</pers> rendered your country were of the literary kind—The <HumanProd>Declaration of Independence</HumanProd> was penned in <loc>your closet</loc> , where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that <HumanProd>Declaration</HumanProd> by any extraordinary exercise, or by exposing yourself to any imminent danger .
When <pers>Governor of Virginia</pers> <pers>you</pers> sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appoint <time>by Congress</time> .
A ; the danger was visi-ble , <pers>you</pers> acted consistently with your chr-racter , but surely did not display either much firmness or patriotism .
But, Sir, weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are not personal defects—they are not faults of your own—tho' were you, conscious of your defects, to accept the important office of President, when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your country are depending, it would, in my opinion, amount to a crime.
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the <pers>had of a party</pers> devoted to the enemies of America , and a <org>party</org> created for her ruin .

THE first number of the <HumanProd>AMERICAN FARMER</HumanProd> , was issued on the <time>2d of April 1819</time> .
It may now be announced as an established <HumanProd>National work</HumanProd> , adapted to all the varieties of our climate , since many of the most eminent citizens in all the states , contribute by their patronage and their pens , to its circulation and its usefulness To make known all discoveries in the <field>science</field> , and all improvements in the practice of <loc>Agriculture</loc> and <loc>Domestic Economy</loc>—and to develop the means and designate plans of internal improvements generally , constitute the chief objects to which the <PERSON>American Farmer</PERSON> is devoted .
It takes no concern or interest in party politics , nor in the transient occurrences of the day .
The Farmer is published weekly, on <time>.
- heel the size of a large newspaper , and folded to make eight pages—and to admit of being conveniently bound up and preserved in volumes .
Each volume will consist of fifty-two numbers, a title page and an index; and numerous Engravings to represent new implements, and approved systems of husbandry Each number gives a true and accurate statement of the <time>th * m selling prices</time> of country produce, live stock and all the principal articles brought for sale in the <loc>Baltimore market</loc>.

Terms of subscription 4 dollars per <time>an</time> <loc>num</loc> , to be paid in advance .
But for the ' ' Urn of five dollars , the actual receipt of eve ¬ ry number is guaranteed .
That , is , when numbers fail to come to hand , duplicates shall be sent until every <time>number</time> shalljiave been received .
As the Editor takes the risk and cost of <org>die mail</org>—should subscription money mis carry , he holds himself , nevertheless , bound to furnish the paper .
To those who may think the price of subscription too high , it may be remarked , that on a comparison of their actual contents , one volume of the <org>American Farmer</org> will be found to contain as much as four volumes of the <org>Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of Philadelphia</org> and the four volumes of that patriotic , and exceedingly valuable work , sell for 12 dollars .
To shew that the American Farmer, is conducted in a manner to answer the great national purpose for which it was * establish - ed .
and that it is not on <loc>ieserving the encou ragement</loc> of the Agriculturists of the <org>Unit; d States</org> , the following testimonials are respectfully submitted—others equally conclusive , might be offered .

There is a great excitement on this sub <time>subject</time> and this excitement is extending .
Meetings have been held in <loc>New York</loc> , <loc>Philadelphia</loc> , <loc>New Haven</loc> and <loc>Hartford</loc> , and memorials to Congress adopted—other meetings will be held in other places .
From the abstract of the debate in the House of Representatives, on the question of referring the New York memorial to the <org>Committee on Indian Affairs</org> , which our readers will find in another part of our paper, there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of <org>Congress</org> ,
Washington, <time>January 25, 1830</time> - Gentlemen .
Your letter of the <time>18ih</time> has been received .
We feel highly gratified to learn , that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable <org>meeting in New - York</org> , against the violation of ’ <org>he trea treaties</org> with the Cherokee and other <org>nations of Indians</org> , meets your approval .
In vindicating the sacred right of the citizen to petition <org>government</org> on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respectable meeting of our fellow citizens , on a subject involving the faith of the nation , its honor and character ; and the existence of a race of men .
now the remnant of a <org>powerful nation</org> ; we did no more than perform a duty ■ incumbent on us .
as the representatives of a free people .
We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration, of what we said on the <time>interesting occasion</time> to which you refer .
We are , most respectfully , Your obedient servants , <pers>A SPENCER HENRY R . STORRS</pers> .
From the <org>Chariest - n Mercury</org> .
Nothing is doing now in Congress, in the lower House, but making mouths, blackguarding, doubling fists, & .
<EMPTY></EMPTY>
& c .

It is sup BY-posited that the decent members will not at  BY-attempt business until the rowdies have ex  BY-hausted themselves—or the House been purged after a general knock down and drag out .
There has as yet been no bloodshed, except a little scratching and hair-pulling in the lobby.
The Senate has done some business, has passed the Sub-Treasury Bill, and seems inclined to be decent, though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock-up the sand scene ‘ good as you sir, ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir, ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — between an old and young one, <pers>Messrs. Clay</pers> and <pers>Walker</pers> other day - Why will 31 r <time>.</time>
Clay disturb the harmony of the <org>Senate</org> , and rutile ( lie even current of his unaspiring course by such discordant scrapes ?
From the <loc>Otmndagiia</loc> ( <org>N . A .</org> ) <org>Standard</org> .
The plan for disciplining the militia, proposed by <pers>Mr. poinsett</pers>, would cost only half a million of dollars annually; while that proposed by <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers>, with the present number of our militia, would cost about <num>FOUR MILLIONS</num> of dollars annually.
Gen. <pers>Harrison</pers> proposed to place the whole force, brought under discipline on his system, distinctly within the control of <org>President</org> .
On the <time>3d of February last</time> , Gen. <pers>Ilarrisou</pers> addressed a letter to the <org>"Louisville Legion</org>" , in which he mentioned the plan here brought to view as one of his principal efforts to improve the discipline of the militia .
And furthermore , <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers>' keepers have assured the public , that his sentiments have undergone “ no change ”.
Of course , then , <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official <org>statiou</org> , if placed in the Presidential chair , the odious and oppressively burthen - some scheme proposed by him <in>in a report</in> to Congress .
Now , when the Western State Journal <org>denounces</org> Gen.<pers>Harrison</pers> <humanprod>plan</humanprod> for organizing the militia , the world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , and which has never received <pers>Mr . Yan</pers>' approval .

From the <loc>Pennsylvanian</loc>.
Harrisburg , <time>June 26</time> , 1S40 .
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the <date>17th iust</date> .
, as well as another <time>letter</time> of similar import , dated <time>16th inst</time> .
, tender <pers>I</pers> to me a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you , just on the eve of my <time>deparure</time> from Philadelphia .
It is a matter of regret to me, <time>that time</time>, and my other indispensable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered hospitality. Allow me to return my warmest thanks for the “ <org>high regard and esteem</org> ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meritorious services.
" I cannot , and I ought not to suppose , that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have distinguished the history of <org>Pennsylvania</org> since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her <loc>government</loc> , every official act I may find it necessary to perform , and every recommendation I may feel called on to make , should meet with unanimous approval .
It would be as unreasonable as it would be vain to look for this .
Some of the questions that have agitated <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> , and required my action upon them , are among the most intricate and perplexed in the whole science of government , aud have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion , in the minds of the wisest and best men in this , aud other countries .
How , then , can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours , where habit , feeling , interest and intelligence are so variously di <loc>versified</loc> and combined in their influence upon different individuals ?
At the time when the executive functions of Pennsylvania passed into my hands , I found them beset with difficulties on all sides .
An overwhelming public debt—the interest <time>seini</time> annually falling due upon it—a stupendous system of public improvements disjointed and unfinished—a banking system, <org>involving</org> an enormous amount of incorporated capital, directly or indirectly connected with the most ofthe business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details indubitable proofs of its usuriness and imperfection—the banking institutions struggling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprises paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended, and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow, without knowing where it would fall, or on what portion with the greatest weight.
Such were some of the <time>porten tous</time> embarrassments encountered at the out <time>set of my ollicial career</ollicial career> , and the worst evils they <time>portended</portended> have been fully realized .
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise, and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the people, according to my solemn <pers>convictions</pers> of out ) ' , and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost <pers>responsibility of my station</pers> .
1 assert no claim to infallibility or judgment , or to a share ef wisdom superior to others , but to undeviating <pers>houesty of purpose</pers> I do avow that I have a <org>title</org> , of which no human power can deprive me .
Forming a part of the Executive does, but a portion of the Legislative power of this commonwealth, he is often reduced to the unavoidable necessity, of sanctioning measures which do not in all respects meet his approval, or to prevent, by refusing such sauciou, any legislation on the subject at all.
Iu several <time>distances</time> I have found myself in this dilemma, when my only choice was, between the two evils of an imperfect <org>law</org> , and no ' <time>egislativ</time> action whatever .
Iu such cases I have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none , and have generally yielded my assent , even though I had objections to some parts of the <time>law</time> .
7 ’ he lato resolutions providing for the time of resuming specie payments by the <org>batiks</org> was one of this description .
I thought at the time and still think that <time>the day fixed</time> was too remote , but I believed the permanent interests of the community required that a day should be designated as speedily as possible for that event , and if it was not so grossly unreasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the time uncertain and indefinite , I should not prevent it becoming a law .
It was , moreover , a subject on which the Legislature had deliberated for months , and the ' fixing the precise day on which it should take place , being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle , a decent respect for the opinions of the people ’ s <pers>representatives</pers> , a majority of whom , in both branches , were elected by men of my own <org>political faith</org> , seemed to forbid the propriety of <org>interposin</org> ' * the negative power , with which the constitution had clothed the Executive .
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best , in whatever aspect it could be viewed .
Accord d'après la théorie et la pratique de notre gouvernement , la législation est une affaire de compromis sur des objets .
No one <pers>co-ordinate</pers> of <org>department</org> has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar <PROD>seutiments</PROD> , on the part of the others .
All that either can do , is to take care that none of its essential <time>principles of constitutional construction</time> , or <org>public policy</org> , shall be violated by the others ; when that is done , the remaining circle of duties can be performed in a spirit of mutual <humanprod>concession and compromise</humanprod> .
This is the doctrine of the <doctrine>constitution</doctrine> , the voice of the people , and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the government in harmony and goodwill .
7 ’ <pers>his</pers> principle affords the explanation of my approval of more measures than one, against portions of which I had <time>objjections</time> ; and it is the only pretext on which the Legislature has refused or omitted to sanction <humanprod>recommendations</humanprod> of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this commonwealth .
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the <org>Legislature</org> on this subject , and it is of the public to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the <org>Legislature</org> , or that body right in refusing to adopt them .
I am gratified, however, in this, that iu most of the views embodied iu my recomendations, the majority of the House of <org>Representatives</org> coincided with me in opinion, aud a number of the Democratic members of the <org>Senate</org> .
They failed , however , of success , and the remedy is in the hands of the people , if they approve of those measures , at the <time>next election</time> .
If they do not, whatever consequences follow, I have done my duty.
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this commonwealth , it will be found , I think , that though much has been left undone , <time>great deal has been accomplished</time> .
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements, sustaining the faith and credit of the state, and terminating the present disastrous suspension of specie payments, with provision which secures the public against like recurrence in future, under a forfeiture of their charters by the banks; and so far as depends on me, will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced.
7 ' <time>he improvement bill</time> , it is universally admitted , contains less objectionable matter than can be found in any prior <time>legislation</time> on that subject .
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance <time>au end</time> that the long practiced system of log-rolling, which has impoverished our treasury to the amount of some millions, is at an end .
7 <time>he</time> precise nature of the difficulties we have labored under, in achieving this much, can only be learned by those who examine with care and caution into our <org>real condition</org> .
All the pecuniary responsibilities, as well as the resources of <loc>Pensylvania</loc>, must be taken into account, in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued .
YY ’ e must take things as they are .
YY ' e cannot retrieve what was done by our predecessors ; and those who expect us to act as if <org>Pencj-lmnnia</org> had no public debt to provide for , unfinished improvements to complete , no public interests to be protected , betray an ignorance of our true situation that entitles either the censure or their praise to very little regard .
7 ' he favorable <pers>he</pers> of those , who , like the gentlemen I ad ¬ address , are familiar with the true interests of<loc>Pennsylvania</loc> , is a gratifying en ¬ couragement to the public man .
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed, those who understand what the best interests of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them.
Even though those endeavors should not in all respects correspond with their own <pers>personal sentiments</pers> .
Differing iu mere matters of detail , I feel convinced that <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> entertains but one fun ¬ damental system of opinion .
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good <time>government</time> .
Recent experience has confirmed this opinion, and assured me that <time>time</time> and <time>experience</time> are the great champions of the democratic cause.
I trust the recent <time>embarrassments</time> of our situation and the means to obviate them , will clearly illustrate this truth .
I am certain that <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> surrounded as she has been by diffi culties on all hands , cau aud will be soon ex ¬ tricated , — that all evils complained of will be corrected , — abuses reformed , - — her <org>contracts</org> fulfilled , and every duty of government be faithfully performed , without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the democratic party of <org>Pennsylvania</org> has ever held dear .
Please accept, gentlemen, for yourselves individually, the assurauce of my high regard and consideration.

Dear Sir : The promiueut attitude which you now occupy in relation to the <humanprod>coining Residential contest</humanprod> , confers upon every voter of this widely extended <loc>Republic</loc> , however humble may be his condition , a right to inquire your views upon each one of those momentous <time>questions which now agitate the public mind</time> .
Prompted, not by an impertinent curiosity, but solely by a desire to ascertaining, whether your views or those of <pers>General Harrison</pers> coincide more nearly with our own, we are induced to propound to you the following questions, viz
: 1 . <pers>AY</pers> , it re-elected President , veto any bill having for its object , the abolition of slavery in the <loc>District of Columbia</loc> ; or would you sanction any bill granting appropriations <misc>o !</misc> the public money , to any <org>State</org> , soliciting aid for the emancipation of <pers>their slaves</pers> ?
2. Do you think that, at this time, the safety of the public money requires a re - chartering of the <org>United States Bank</org> ; or would you sign a bill chartering such an institution ?
3 . Are you in favor of preserving entire the <prod>Tariff Compromise</prod>

4 . YA <pers>you</pers> would you sanction any bill granting appropriations of the public money , for the purposes of internal improvement , by means of <HumanProd>canals</HumanProd> , <HumanProd>railroads</HumanProd> , $ ; c .

THE HEW COUNTY BRIDGE AND <loc>School, House</loc> .
Le nouveau pont comté sur le James river , juste au sud de la ville , est terminé et prêt pour la fréquentation publique .
Its entire length is 160 <length>leet</length> , and its substruction is built of 12x12 <length>timbers</timbers> , with a covering 16 <length>leet</length> wide , made of 7 inch <length>plank</plank> , with a railing 3 feet <length>high</high> on each side .
The bridge was constructed by <pers>Peter Auberton</pers> of <loc>this city</loc> .
Mr . Auberton also took the ^ contract for building the <loc>village school house</loc> for this place , which he expects to have done by <time>the first of February</time> .
The school building is 30x42, <time>28 feet high</time> above the stone foundation—which stands 2 feet above the ground; there is a partition, cutting off 12 feet from the front of the building, to be used for a stairway and entry room, leaving the school room on the first floor <time>30 feet square</time> .
The front porch which faces toward the <direction>south</direction> , is 8x12 , and gracefully ornamented with different kinds of scroll work .
The cupola or belfry <loc>is 8 feet square</loc> and very neatly finished .
The height from the top of the flag staff on the cupola to the ground is <time>62 feet high</time>.
The structure is in every way first class , and cost about $3000 <./SENTENCE>
' Mr . <pers>Auberton</pers> a fait beaucoup de travail pour le comté de Stutsman , ayant construit la cour house early in the fall , et nous comprendre que son travail a ainsi fait jusqu'à présent donné une satisfaction entière .
A Bit oT Daring .
A Western paper tells the story of <pers>Steve Venard</pers> ’ s fight with three <pers>robbers</pers> in <time>1866</time> .
The stage coming to <loc>Nevada</loc> , Col.
, had been robbed by three <pers>men</pers> , and the <prod>treasure-box</prod> taken .
A party set out for its recovery .
Yenard , armed with a <prod>Henry rifle</prod> , followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rugged <loc>region</loc> .
The hills hung steep above .
The waters of the ravine came tumbling down its steep bed of <terrain>bowlders</terrain> with a rush and a noise which rendered no other sounds audible .
Yenard attempted to cross the <loc>stream at the head of the fall</loc> .
He walked on a short <loc>log</loc> to a <loc>rock</loc>.
Above him rose the huge mass of <terrain>granite</terrain> , buttressed in front by two smaller <terrain>rocks</terrain> .
Between these latter was an alley which led to the <loc>base of the Titan</loc> .
His position was <time>suen</time> as to look up the alley .
At the base of the great rock <loc>Yenard</loc> discovered the leader of the gang sitting on the ground drawing his revolver .
Venard leveled his rifle upon the <pers>robber</pers> , twenty feet distant .
At the same time he saw an <orb>other</orb> of the <org>gang</org> pointing at him over the edge of a <loc>rock</loc>.
There was no time to change his aim .
He fired ; the leader fell back , shot through the heart .
The other robber attempted to shield himself farther behind a <loc>rock</loc> , leaving the point of his pistol exposed over the top .
Venard covered the spot with his unerring <weapon>Henry</weapon> , and when the head of the robber peered over the top, his <PERSON>brain</PERSON> was pierced with a bullet .
There was yet another , but he was not to be seen .
His pistol might at that moment be pointing at <pers>Yenard</pers> .
The latter clambered up to beard him in his <loc>den</loc>.
He found the <time>treasure</time> , took the pistols from the dead , covered quickly the former with <loc>earth and leaves</loc> , and proceeded to hunt the missing <pers>robber</pers> .
He found him running up the <loc>mountain</loc> , sixty yards or more ahead .

Another bullet , and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead .
TUB SCHOOL BOARD : Just what our <org>school board</org> propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear , but it ia safe to predict that no <pers>lady teacher</pers> will get the school .
The majority of the <org>board</org> are very much opposed to such an arrangement , and so long as they are <pers>our people</pers> have but little to fear from them in that direction .
W "believe that the board desire to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the people
Mr . <pers>Lees</pers> , as well as <pers>McKechnie</pers> , stated to us not long since , that they would not in any degree favor the installation of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests <org>of the people</org> .
We do not oppose the hiring of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> because we are particularly prejudiced against them , for we are not , and believe that some of the most reliable and able teachers that bless our land to - day are <pers>ladies</pers> .
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present , and we are of the opinion that we cannot , could a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , with no more than ordinary ability do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the <loc>county</loc> will agree with us when we answer most emphatically , no .
If our county was able to stand the extra expense we would be In favor of hiring two teachers instead of one .
Could we see our way clear in this direction we would then favor the engagement of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department , leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the hands of a capable <pers>gentle man teacher</pers> .
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against <pers>Mrs . Shoe ¬ maker</pers> , and therefore are opposed to her being engaged is basely false .
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately, in regard to <pers>Mrs . Shoemaker</pers> which would in any way convey the idea that we are personally prejudiced against her .
We are not in favor of her teaching the school for the same reasons that we would oppose any other <pers>lady teacher</pers> who might be endeavoring to get it .
A little over a year ago the <org>Sturgeon Lendcr</org> published a very sensational account of the marriage of <pers>Miss Nettie White</pers> to <pers>Robert</pers> .
L . Winn .
Miss <pers>White</pers> .<time>at the time</time> , was engaged to both <pers>Chas</pers> .
and <pers>Robert</pers>.
Winn , <pers>two brothers</pers> , but had much difficulty in deciding which of her <pers>lovers</pers> was the <HumanProd>wbichest</HumanProd> .

, however , proved to be the successful suitor .
The young couple recently agreed to disagree, and the faithless <pers>Robert</pers>.
left for <loc>Texas</loc> , and the young wife returned to the home of her <pers>parents</pers> , and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant <pers>spouse</pers> upon the <time>grounds</time> of desertion .
The prospects for a re-hearing for the <pers>disconsolate Charles</pers> , who has spent the intervening time in repining , are growing very bright , as the young lady now declares that she really loved <pers>Charles</pers> best in the first place .
<ORG>The firm of Geo</ORG>.
D . <org>Barnard</org> <abbr>Isr</abbr> . <loc>Co</loc> , of <loc>St. Louis</loc> , is a <org>firm</org> which some officials in this county give a great many orders for <product>letter beads</product> , <product>envelopes</product> and such other <product>blanks</product> as could be furnished by the <org>printing offices</org> in this county , are all <pers>Republicans</pers> , but <pers>Mr . Keene</pers> , their traveling <job>sales man</job> in this territory , we understand , is a <pers>Democrat</pers> .
We have been in <org>Messrs . Barnard & Co</org> are not uni-form in their prices .
For instance , ’ a certain <prod>blank book</prod> they have been <org>known to sell</org> in Montgomery county for $17 .
In St . Charles county they place “ <time>un tarif</time> ” of SI ' , on the same book , and in Lincoln county the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from '' <money>$21</money> for the very same book .
We presume their prices are made in proportion to the number of pocket-knives , gold pens , etc. , they give away to capture an order .
If Democratic county of <org>officials</org> will send their orders abroad for job work , let them , at least , patronize <org>Democratic firms</org> .
Curiosities of the Postage Stamp .
There are about 6,000 varieties of postage stamps now in use by the <org>different nations</org> of the world .
The museum of the Berlin <org>post</org> - <loc>cfllce</loc> alone contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens , half of which are European and the remainder divided between <loc>America</loc> , <loc>Asia</loc> , <loc>Africa</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc> .
The emblems upon the stamps of <org>nations</org> are legion ; the earth , the sea and the vaulted canopy above have been ransacked for curious and mraning less devices and <time>legends</time> .
The en ¬ re entire animal kingdom, the stars and the moon in all its phases, besides legendary emblems by the thousand, are known to the <org>collectors of stamps</org> , who pride themselves upon being “ <HumanProd>philatelists</HumanProd>” .
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be found * } the names of five <pers>emperors</pers> , eighteen <pers>kings</pers> , three <pers>queens</pers> , one <pers>grand duke</pers> , several <pers>rulers</pers> and many <pers>presidents</pers> .
M . <pers>Pliillippe de Ferrari</pers> perhaps has the largest and most valuable <humanprod>collection of stamps</humanprod> in the world , amounting to something like <quantity>2ft0,000</quantity> , and within the present year he sold one little stamp to a collector in <loc>Paris</loc> for <quantity>150.000</quantity> .
In England and other parts of Europe , horseshoes are now in use , made of <prod>cowhide</prod> instead of <prod>iron</prod> .
The shoe is composed of three thick <HumanProd>thicknesses</HumanProd> of the <HumanProd>hide</HumanProd> which is pressed into a solid <loc>steel mould</loc> and after <time>ward</time> treated by a <HumanProd>chemical process</HumanProd> .
It is said to be far superior, in several particulars, to the <prod>iron shoe</prod>.
<loc>AGRICULTURE</loc> ON THE YUKON.


Vice Consul <pers>Morrison</pers> of Dawson City , sends to Washington a report on the results of agricultural experiments , written by a <pers>resident</pers> of that day .
which reads in part , as follows : " Grain has done exceptionally well , being well filled , and I see no reason why <prod>It</prod> should not be extensively and successfully grown here .
As far as my observations go .
the climate here is as suit ¬ able for raising winter wheat as in any place in the <loc>northwestern or the north ¬ ern states of America</loc> .
From my ex <pers>experience</pers> of the last two <time>years</time> .
1 see no reason why this country should not be able to produce its <HumanProd>own vegetables and grains</HumanProd> .
As for flowers , the success I have had proves that all <PROD>hardy annuals</PROD> will do well .
The coming year I in <> INTENT > intend <TIME>planting several hundred</TIME> hybrid roses , also <TIME>summer flowering bulbs</TIME> , a large variety of other hardy and half - hardy <TIME>annuals</TIME> , and some of the hardy <TIME>perennials</TIME> .
Small fruit , such as straw <prod>strawberries</prod> .

blackberries and raspberries should do well .

<TIME>The Shirt Waist.</TIME>
Very inviting are the displays of <org>Ox ¬ fords</org> , cheviots , zephyrs and madras cloths for the shirt waist , and the made - up models have already pushed out of place their winter representa ¬ tives in cloth , velvet and fine <loc>llannels</loc> .
We shall wear the comfortable wools , aye , and even buy them for some time to come , but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the thinner <prod>successeurs</prod> .
A pretty feature in the wash <PROD>waist</PROD> for next <TIME>summer</TIME> is their <PROD>simplicity</PROD> .
The human form divine is to have a chance to breathe once more , for the voluminous starchy fronts are no more .
Even those professing to be loose have no surplus material , and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain , fitted over <loc>shoulders</loc> and bust and buttoned simply down the <loc>back</loc> .
Red dotted swiss has the entire front crossed <loc>In diamonds</loc> of white val insertion , the undarted front Just puck <loc>puckered</loc> a little at the belt , the plain back closed with bullet - shaped <prod>pearl buttons</prod> .
The close sleeves have a tight <org>cult</org> , and the simple , unlined collar has little oblong turnovers of <loc>Swiss</loc> and <loc>Valenciennes</loc> lace .
Another style for these butt<loc>waists</loc> is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting .
Ibis Is of the styte <PROD>Ibis</PROD> which is purchased ready tucked and joined , and saves infinite labor , besides being nicer than the most careful home <PERS>seamstress</PERS> could make it .
Madras waists , aiso have a slender - <loc>rest</loc> of tucking , running down to a point at the <loc>waist</loc> , and have little re - vers from the <loc>neck</loc> to the <loc>bust</loc> on each side .
These are also of tucking and simply finished with a frill of narrow lace .
Large collars and full, fussy revers are not shown at all.
There is every evidence that the <time>1900 summer</time> girl proposes, above all, to be sweetly cleanly.
Her waists say plainly enough that it will be a simple matter to wash and Iron them , and there need be no lack In their number for that reason .
One feature which marks them ns new and far prettier than the old shirt waists is the entire absence of yokes of any kind , even In the back .
The only semblance of a yoke is the one which is trimmed and applied to the shoulders , forming a little epaulet over the sleeves .

FOREIGN WORDS .
Soma General Rule * That Will Aid In Pro sbi pronouncing Them .
Many foreign words have become a part of <lang>English</lang> language through frequent use and It Is wise and proper to pronounce them according to <lang>English</lang> rules .
There are , on the other hand , <time>ninny words</time> that do not readily lend themselves to the English style of pronunciation , or that are not used often enough to warrant it .
In pro <org>announcing</org> such words the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the foreign languages .
In Latin, two vowels are not put In one syllable unless they are joined as a diphthong.
There are as many syl <prod>syllables</prod> as there are vowels in a word .
( Si ' - ne di ' - e for sine die . » In German, the letter <org>w</org> has the sound of <org>v</org> in English . ( <pers>Vahg ' - ner</pers> for <pers>Wagner</pers> . )
Tlie same is true in French , though w is only found in words that have been borrowed from other lan guages .
The letter i in German and in the Latin tongues, <lang>viz:</lang> French, Italian and Spanish, <time>lias</time> the sound of long e.
( Peek for <pers>pique</pers> , Fr. : Bee 'an-ko for <pers>Bianco</pers> , It. ; I > ee '-os for <pers>Dios</pers> , Sp. )
In the Latin tongues , also , the letter <loc>a</loc> generally , though not always has the broad sound , while the letter <loc>o</loc> has the long sound .
Tlie letter c in I tali : <time>n</time> when fol <time>followed</time> by e or i <time>ims</time> the sound of eh .
( <loc>Viu ' - cliee</loc> for <loc>Vinci</loc> ).
Final consonants in French are nearly always silent .
( Pah for Pas . )
So also is final e silent unless, an accent mark is placed above it.
The aecentiMl e has the sound of long a in English or a sound quite close to that .
The syllables in French words are never accented as in English words .
All of them are supposed to receive equal emphasis , but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into <time>the next word</time> .
The French make frequent use of nasal vowels, so - called, <time>lie</time> correct pronunciation of which ' <loc>lie</loc>' is difficult to acquire.
The nasal vowel is composed of a vowel and a consonant—<prod>m</prod> or <prod>n</prod>.
The consonant is practically silent, but serves to give the nasal tone to the vowel.
The pronunciation of the word <prod:salon</prod> , ( for example ) as given In Web ¬ ster ’ s dictionary .
[No named entities found in the input sentence.]
It should be observed that in the front of the <org>dietionary</org> it is explicitly stated that this ng is silent , being used only to convey the idea of tin * nasal sound .

Why does Great Britain buy its oatmeal from us ?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to speak of exjxirt-ing oatmeal to Scotland and yet, every year the Quaker Oats Company sends hundreds of thousands of cases of Quaker Oats to <loc>Great Britain</loc> and Europe, <time>The reason is simple;</time> while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically, and active mentally of all people, the <org>American</org> has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade.

CRIMSON CLOVER I had a short article in last week ’ s <org>Herald</org> on the importance of crimson clover , and I have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil .
<time>Now</time>
I am not acquainted with all the farmers who have grown <PROD>crimson clover</PROD> in ' Putnam county' and I wish I was .
I would have a great many more short articles published , but to any one who has grown this crop and feels like recommending it to his farmer friends please write a short piece and send to me or <org>the Herald</org> with your name signed , so we can see who has had the experience .
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of crimson clover : First , prepare - the <loc>seed bed</loc> well .
Make the seed / bed as for <PROD>wheat or clover</PROD> and sow 15 to 20 lbs .
of se6d to the acre and if there has not been other clover grown on the land recently, inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise Inoculation should be applied .

Either get some soil from <loc>clover field</loc> or get the liquid inocula <HumanProd>inoculation</HumanProd> and inoculate the seed before sowing , but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the bright sunlight .
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in ’ the shade to dry and then sow in the <time>early morning or in the evening or on</time> .
a cloudy day with the <prod>harrow</prod> following the seeding .
In this way the inoculation is <time>effective</time> .
Apply when seeding cromson clover some 15 per cent <prod>acid phosphate</prod> from 100 to 300 pounds to the acre .
Tn this way the clover gets a good growth and the better the clover grows the more nitrogen it gathers and stores in .
the soil
* If you are sowinf for a pas ¬ ture and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of <prod>rye</prod> with the <prod>crimson clover</prod> .
It will finish more pasture and help to hold the clover .
Hoping to see your testimony of growing crimson clover in the paper next week , if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow , let us hear from you .

CLEARING UP THE EDENTON CENSUS COUNT <org>Edentonians</org> have berm raising quite a squawk over the census re <time>returns</time> , They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their duties , that the carriers beak ; cf the <loc>Edcnton</loc> <org>pnsloff.ee</org> shows that the <org>poslofficc</org> serves approximate ¬ly 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they arc clamoiing for a new enumeration .
[NO NAMED ENTITIES DETECTED]
s - id as <org>Chamber ef Csmmcrcc</org> and press ballyhoo .
Edentonians have been boasting ‘for several years that the population of their town was more than 5,000' when the official count revealed only <number>3.519</number>. Edentonians were disappointed and began to grumble. Several suspicious busybodies, anxious to boost the population of their town, borrowed the carrier’s books from the postoffice and counted all the names therein. They found nearly <number>4,500</number> names in the books. And immediately a cry was raised: ‘We want, a new tabulation. There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us.
Bui it was just so much hokum, in the opinion of a <pers>representative</pers> of the District Supervisor's office. If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edenton's population is ever the 4.000 mark, they didn't succeed in fooling anyone else. When a person or a family moves to a town, the name is placed in the <org>carrier's</org> book. But, when they leave town, their names are not struck off the books!; . Go everyone who moved to Edenton from 1920 to 1930 was <org>registered</org> in the <org>postoffice</org> carriers' books, and the names of everyone who moved from Edenton in that time were not removed from the books. Edentonians even wanted to in - ' elude in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians ' working away from Edenton, but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by Uncle Gam. So the <time>official</time> census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519. Edentonians’ protests to the conti aiy notwithstanding.

There is no greater farce than the diabolically “ <time>sep ¬ arate . but equal</time> ” system in educational institutions and public carriers, of which the Southland adheres to so tenaciously. Several of the southern states, notably <org>Texas</org>, <org>Arkansas</org>, and <org>Oklahoma</org>, have let down their bars of segregation, and have agreed to abide by the <org>Supreme Court</org> ruling of admitting Negroes into the white <loc>sante-fte</loc> - supported institutions. <PERSON>It SEEMS that the learned judges of the Florida Supreme Court have “ strained at a mountain and produced a knat ”</PERSON>.
