In all the cases given above , except one or two which are specified , <ORG>O</ORG> has preserved the correct reading , and almost invariably sides with <ORG>L</ORG> against <ORG>A</ORG> .
A few of <ORG>O</ORG>'s minor corrections of <ORG>A</ORG> are omitted ; 6 , <DATE>δ .</DATE> in accent as <DATE>495</DATE> . <PERS>τῶνδέ τοι</PERS> : 628 , <PERS>μεθεῖσά μοι</PERS> , where <ORG>A</ORG> omits the acute accent : 779 . <DATE>δε</DATE> <ORG>O</ORG> . <DATE>δεῖν᾽</DATE> <ORG>A</ORG> : 890 . <WORK>μώραν</WORK> <ORG>O</ORG> . <WORK>μωρὰν</WORK> <ORG>A</ORG> : 1433 . <PERS>Bare</PERS> <ORG>O</ORG> . <WORK>Bite</WORK> <ORG>A</ORG> : 149% . <PERS>πᾶσ᾽</PERS> <ORG>O</ORG> . <PERS>πάσ '</PERS> <ORG>A</ORG> .
These illustrate the minute accuracy of <ORG>O</ORG> .
3 - From this list of readings it is plain that <ORG>O</ORG> is a more correct MS . than <ORG>A</ORG> , and a fairer representative of the family of MSS . to which <ORG>A</ORG> belongs .
The list of differences just given, in almost all of which <PERS>O</PERS> corrects <PERS>A</PERS>'s errors, clearly shows <PERS>A</PERS>'s tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to <PERS>A</PERS>'s family, but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of <PERS>O</PERS>'s original.
The many places where the text of A omits a word or is corrupt , but where O supplies the omission and confirms L and the correct text , show that O certainly represents the text of an earlier date than A , when it was still <WORK>pure</WORK> from many <WORK>corruptions</WORK> and <WORK>errors</WORK> which A has gathered .
4 . <PERS>Certain</PERS> corruptions are common to both <ORG>O</ORG> and <ORG>A</ORG> , and must have crept into the text of this family of the <WORK>MSS</WORK> at a <DATE>date</DATE> considerably anterior to that of <ORG>A</ORG> .
The following is a list of all the errors common to <ORG>O</ORG> and <ORG>A</ORG> , which can be properly called errors of <ORG>A</ORG>'s <WORK>family</WORK> .
A very few minor divergencies of accent and orthography are omitted

The Chorus are uncertain of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> ’ whereabouts, as <PERS>Odysseus</PERS> was , <WORK>supr . 33</WORK> ; <WORK>μακραίωνι</WORK> implies that some time had passed since the judgment of the arms and <PERS>Ajax</PERS> ’ sullen withdrawal from the fight : <WORK>cp</WORK> . <WORK>infr . 929 foll</WORK> <WORK>ἀγωνίῳ</WORK> is a difficult word .
The inactivity of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> was his manner of contending with the <PERS>chiefs</PERS> : if the rumour was true , it was an inactivity in which he had been <WORK>fatally</WORK> active ; and however his <WORK>leisure</WORK> was employed, it was becoming <WORK>full</WORK> of danger to him ,

The form τρανός was current in later Greek ; the earliest instance seems to be <PERS>Dionys</PERS> <WORK>. Halic.</WORK> ( <DATE>c . 25 B . C .</DATE> )
De Comp . Verborum c . 22 τρανὴν καὶ καθαρὰν δύναμιν . ἀλώμεθα : this fig . sense , with ref . to uncertainty ‘to be at sea , ’ as we say ) , belongs nowhere else to this verb <WORK>αλώμεθα</WORK> , but often to <WORK>πλανᾶσθαι</WORK> ( <WORK>Her . 6 . 37</WORK> , etc . ; <WORK>Plat .

24 θελοντής . The form <WORK>ἐθελοντής</WORK> occurs in <ORG>Herodotus</ORG> , <ORG>Thucydides</ORG> , <ORG>Xenophon</ORG>, and the <ORG>Orators</ORG> ; as <WORK>ἐθελοντήρ</WORK> does in <WORK>Od</WORK> . <SCOPE>2</SCOPE> <SCOPE>. 292</SCOPE> .

Similarly <PERS>ἐθελήμων</PERS> is the form used by <PERS>Plato</PERS> ( <WORK>Crat .</WORK> <SCOPE>406 A</SCOPE> ) , while the earliest authority for <PERS>θελήμων</PERS> is <PERS>Apollonius Rhodius</PERS> ( <WORK>2 .</WORK> <SCOPE>557</SCOPE> ) .
In ragio iambics θέλω was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to <WORK>ἐθέλω</WORK> , though the latter occurs in <WORK>O . T .</WORK> <SCOPE>1303</SCOPE> and <WORK>Ph .</WORK> <SCOPE>145</SCOPE> anapaests.
If <PERS>θελοντής</PERS> were found in a <WORK>passage</WORK> where <WORK>metre</WORK> required it , the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection .
But where , as here , aphaeresis was available , it is surely more probable that the poet wrote <WORK>ἐθελοντᵝ</WORK> <WORK>. — <PERS>ὑπεῖύγην</PERS> , as if the task were a <WORK>yoke</WORK> <WORK>under which he placed himself</WORK> : cp . <WORK>P</WORK> <SCOPE>1025</SCOPE> <WORK>κλοπῇ</WORK> <WORK>τε</WORK> <WORK>κἀνάγκη</WORK> <WORK>ξυγείς</WORK> ( <WORK>n</WORK> . )

But , since there were two tents and two entrances : δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of <WORK>πύλαις</WORK> ; i. e. , the literal sense is , ‘two doors of <PERS>chiefs</PERS> ’ .
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent, so that only one entrance could be meant by <WORK>πύλαις</WORK>, then, indeed, <WORK>δισσαῖς</WORK> could be explained only as referring to the subst.<WORK>στρατηγίσιν</WORK>, “ the tent-door of two chiefs, ’ = <WORK>δισσοστρατηγίσιν</WORK> <WORK>πύλαις</WORK> .
