In <WORK>ragio iambics</WORK> <SCOPE>θέλω</SCOPE> was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to <SCOPE>ἐθέλω</SCOPE>, though the latter occurs in tragic anapaests ( as <WORK>O.</WORK> <SCOPE>T.</SCOPE> <SCOPE>1303</SCOPE>, <WORK>Ph.</WORK> <SCOPE>145</SCOPE> ).
If <WORK>θελοντής</WORK> were found in a <WORK>pasage</WORK> where <WORK>metre</WORK> required it, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection.
But <PERS>where</PERS> , as <PERS>here</PERS> , <SCOPE>aphaeresis</SCOPE> was available, it is surely more probable that the <PERS>poet</PERS> wrote <SCOPE>ἐθελοντής</SCOPE> . — <SCOPE>ὑπεῖύγην</SCOPE> , as if the <SCOPE>task</SCOPE> were a <OBJECT>yoke</OBJECT> under which he placed himself : cp . <WORK>P.</WORK> <SCOPE>1025</SCOPE> <SCOPE>κλοπῇ</SCOPE> τε κἀνάγκη <SCOPE>ξυγείς</SCOPE> ( <SCOPE>n.</SCOPE> )

The phrase is equivalent, of course, to <WORK>δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις</WORK>.
721 <WORK>στρατήγιον</WORK> , n .
But, since there were two tents and two <LOC>entrances</LOC>, δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i.e., the literal sense is, ‘two <WORK>doors</WORK> of chiefs.’
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent, so that only one entrance could be meant by <SCOPE>πύλαις</SCOPE>, then, indeed, <SCOPE>δισσαῖς</SCOPE> could be explained only as referring to the subst. implied in <WORK>στρατηγίσιν</WORK>, “the tent-door of two chiefs,” = <SCOPE>δισσοστρατηγίσιν</SCOPE> <SCOPE>πύλαις</SCOPE>.
But such a use of <WORD>δισσαῖς</WORD> seems impossible.
