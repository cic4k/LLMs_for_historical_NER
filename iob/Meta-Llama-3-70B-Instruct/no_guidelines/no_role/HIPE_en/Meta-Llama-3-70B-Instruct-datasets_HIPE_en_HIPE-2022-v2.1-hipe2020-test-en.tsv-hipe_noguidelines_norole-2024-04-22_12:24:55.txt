To his <pers>EXCELLENCY</pers> the <org>GOVERNOR</org> <pers>GINIA</pers>.
<loc>NEW - YORK</loc>, <time>SEPT. 28, 1780</time>.
SIR, W E have long waited in anxious expectations, of having it in our power to tranlinit effec ¬ tual Amendments to the Conftitution of the <loc>Uni ¬ ted Stares</loc>, and it is with grief that we now fend forward propolitions inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments, and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our country.
By perufing the <humanprod>Journal of the Senate</humanprod>, your Excellency will fee, that we did, in vain, bring to view the Amend ¬ ments propofed by our <org>Convention</org>, and approv ¬ ed by the <org>Legiflature</org>.
We fltall tranfmit a com ¬ plete let of the Journals of both Houfes of Con - grefsto your addrefs, which with a letter accom panying them, we entreat your Excellency will have the gaodnefs to lay before the Honorable <org>Legillature</org> of the enfuing meeting.
We have the honor, of every ( entiment of rc - fpeCt, to be, Sir, your Excellency ’ s moft obedient, and very humble fervants, <pers>RICHARD HENRY LEE</pers> <pers>WILLIAM GRAYSON</pers>.
<pers>PRESIDENT SULL IVAN</pers> ’ s MESSAGE.
To the <pers>Hon</pers>.
Senate and House ^ /'<org>Represen¬tatives</org>, [ 0 / <loc>New - Hampshire</loc>. ] Gentlemen, H HVING been informed, that doubts have a - rifen iu the minds of fome, whether my hav ¬ ing accepted the office of <humanprod>Diftricft Judge</humanprod> has not difqualified me from aefling as <humanprod>Prefident of the State</humanprod>, until a new election takes place, I confefs that 1 have never been able to difcover any in ¬ compatibility in the two offices.
But as fome have attempted to prove this by urging the words of a <HumanProd>Conflitution</HumanProd> framed for thepurpofe of efta - blifhing over the people of <LOC>New - Humpfhire</LOC> a free, fovereign and independent government — 1 mull obferve, that this govennent has [ nice been changed by the voice of the people, who have agreed that their fafety depended on their relinquifhuig many of the powers retained by the people in that <HumanProd>Conflitution</HumanProd>, to a <ORG>General Government</ORG> eflabl'fbed for the people of each and every <LOC>State</LOC> who fnould adopt it ; which to themwai to become the general law of the land.
The people of this <loc>State</loc> did, in the most folemn manner, a dipt arid ratify that <humanprod>Conflitution</humanprod> ; and from that e - vent, this ceased to be a free, sovereign, andindependent <loc>state</loc> ; and upon my being elcdled to the office of <pers>Prefident</pers>, I was only fworn to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as <pers>Prefident</pers> of a free and confederate <loc>State</loc> ; and I was at or near the fame time fworn to fupport the <humanprod>Confti union</humanprod> of the <loc>United States</loc>, by virtue ofalaw enacted by yourfelves.
I was appointed under that Conflitution which the people of <loc>New - Hampffiire</loc> had adopted for themfelves, a Judge of the <org>Federal Court</org>.
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the <org>people</org>, and could not devife a way of re - figning the truft committed to me, but into the hands who honoured me with it.
I well knew that the time for electing a new <pers>Prefident</pers> was near at hand, when the people might have an op ¬ portunity of declaring who fhould prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been en - trufted to my care, and the affairs of the <org>State</org> un ¬ folded to me, I could not, without an unpardona - ble breach of truft, negleifl to lay them before you.
I alfo confidered, that while I was living in the <loc>State</loc>, no other perfon could, by your own laws, adminilter the neceffary oaths to you, to qualify you to aeft as Legifiators, while the time for which I was chofen was not expired ; and as I knew that this would probably be the laft feflion of this <org>Court</org>, for the prefent <time>year</time> ; and I had no inclination to propofe myfelf as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have pre ¬ vented fome perfons from purfuing the methods they have adopted, for gratifying a fpirit which ought never to lodge itfelf in the branch of a Legifla - ture.
Gentlemen, You will fee the fituation I am in, and may eafily conceive of my feelings upon this fubjeeft, being brought forward, at every opportunity, to fa ’ - tiate that fpirit which has often, before this fejjion of the <org>Court</org>, difplayed itfelf before me, and ufed every effort againfl me.
The <org>Prefident</org> and <org>Senate</org> of the <loc>United States</loc> were, at the <time>time</time> of my appointment, well ac ¬ quainted with my having to finifh my year in prefiding over this <loc>State</loc> ; but no hint has ever been given tome of my acceptance of an office under the prefent general government, rendering void any <loc>State</loc> appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often, fince my accep ¬ tance of the office of <humanprod>Diftridl Judge</humanprod> for <loc>New - Hampfttire</loc>, in company with the <org>Prefident</org> of the <loc>United States</loc>, who knew I was the <org>Prefident</org> of this <loc>State</loc>, and treated me as fuch, although he at the fame time knew that I had long before accept ¬ ed the office of <humanprod>Federal Judge</humanprod>.
I know the candour and juftice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightnefs to fuppofe, that they will fuffer themfelves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more, who cannot avoid at every opportunity, difeovering the fpirit which alhi - ates them in their conduB.
<pers>I</pers> have the honour, & c.

<loc>LONDON</loc>, <time>Dec. 31</time>.
The official account of the capture of <loc>Bruffels</loc> published by the <org>Patriots</org>, is as under.
It is dated the <time>12th of December</time>.
“ At length, notwithftanding the armifiice, and every other pretence, joo brave Patriots of <loc>Brufiels</loc> have dared to engage in battle with 6poo <loc>Aullrains</loc>.
The action commenced <time>yesterday</time> af <time>ternoon</time>, at <time>four o’ clock</time>.
The firft attenpt was to make prifoners of all the loldiers who guarded the <loc>Mint</loc>, and thofe who were quartered in the different <loc>converts</loc>.
<pers>General D ’ Alton</pers> did his tu ¬ rnoff from fix o ’ clock in the morning to negociate an armifiice.
About ( even <time>o ’ clock</time>, 8co men of <loc>Benden</loc> - D ’ <pers>Aloft</pers> entered the city with two pieces of cannon, which they planted on the <loc>Grand Pa ¬ lace</loc>.
About <time>ten o ’ clock</time> General <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> thought proper to fend a large dctatchment in order to releafe, by forcible means, the ollicers and pri ¬ vates made prifoners in the <loc>Bafleville</loc>.
This was the signal for a new engagement, which will be ever memorable for its victory.
The <org>Patriots</org> no longer able to contain themselves, routed the whole detatchment.
To the number of joo, at the utmoft, they invelled the great market, and after a mod obllinatc conflict, they made them ¬ felves mafters of the <loc>Coros de Garde</loc>, and two pieces of cannon, and took obotlt 400 <loc>Auftrians</loc> prifoners.
About the fame time the engagement re - commenced in all quarters of the <loc>city</loc> ; and, in lefs than two hours, the <org>Patriots</org> made themfelves matter of the barracks of the military and of the magazines, in which they found near 2,000 muf - kets, befides cartridges, ammunition, & c.
To ¬ wards noon, they attacked the <loc>Park</loc> and the <loc>Pal ¬ ace Royale</loc>, where the greateft body of troops were concentered, with 12 pieces or cannon.
After a very heavy firing on both fides, <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> perceiving that the place was no longer tenable againtt fo much bravery, capitulated for the im ¬ mediate retreat of his whole gerrifon ; and the requell having been acceded to, about one o ’ clock they departed, with great precipitation, through the <loc>Porte de Namur</loc>.
But as all the foldieis arc not equally inclined to follow hinj, at the mo ¬ ment this is writing, they are fquabbling among theinlelves, without the <loc>city</loc>.
Already, we have got more than 3,000 <humanprod>prifoners</humanprod> ; but a few killed, and no <loc>houfes</loc> plundered.
For the <org>Gazstte of the Unites States</org>, i Letter I. TO <pers>THOMAS JEFFERSON</pers>, <pers>Vise President of the Unit</pers>.
!
<loc>States</loc>, <loc>Philad</loc> : <time>July 3, 1800</time>.
AS you are a candidate for the Supreme - Magistracy of the <org>United States</org>, a know ¬ ledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country.
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in politi ¬ cal concerns, I would not have troubled you for the public with these setters, since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then, <pers>Sir</pers>, have Aided down the current of Use in obscurity, and at least have had the consolation to know that your de ¬ formities were hidden from the world.
But, as, <pers>Sir</pers>, you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations, and now offer yourself as a candidate for the <humanprod>Presi - drncy</humanprod>, you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character, which, from a false opinion of, your country may perhitps confide her dearest interest to.
It is my duty, as it is my wiffi, to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess, and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered <loc>America</loc> in the course of a long life busied with public cares, — - But, Sir, it is also my duty to speak ot those other qualities of your'heart and mind which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country.
Nature, <pers>Sir</pers>, in profusion, gifted you with talents, a brilliant fancy, penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction, combined with a thirst for knowledge, formed you a man of learning and taste, well acquainted with the <humanprod>classics</humanprod>, deeply read in the philoso - phy of <humanprod>natural history</humanprod>, observant of men and things, and attentive in theory to political concerns.
But, to balance tin fe singular favors, stie denied you others, which, to “ move in the tempestuous sea of <loc>liberty</loc>, " or guide the helm of a great <loc>nation</loc>, are of more utility and absolutely indispensable.
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ;, your mind is fitted for a sedentary life, and in your closet you may study, with honor to yourself, the works of <HumanProd>Nature</HumanProd> ; but the fatigues, perseverance and firm Mnper, nectssiry in an Executive sta ¬ tion, would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger, and rendered an enlightened under ¬ standing useless to its possessor and injurious to his country.
Let me conjure you, <pers>Sir</pers>, to call to your remembrance the history of your political life, and from a regard to your peace and reputation, not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the <humanprod>Presidency</humanprod>.
You have been, <pers>Sir</pers>, a Governor, an Ambassador, and a Secretary of State, and had to desert each of these posts, from that weakness of nerves, want of fortitude and total imbecility of character, which have marked your whole political carier, and most probably will at ¬ tend you to your grave.
Remember, <pers>Sir</pers>,, all the services youevei rendered your coun ¬ try were of the literary kind—The <humanprod>Declaration of Independence</humanprod> was penned in, your closet, where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that <humanprod>Declaration</humanprod> by any extraordinary exer ¬ tion, or by exposing yourself to any immi ¬ nent danger.
When <pers>Governor</pers> - os <loc>Virginia</loc>, you sled from your state because a storm was gathering, and declined a foreign appoint ¬ ment by <org>Congress</org>.
A ; the danger was visi - ble, you acted consistently with your chr - racter, but surely did not display either much firmness or patriotism.
But, Sir, weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are nayiral defects—they are not faults of your own—tho ’ were you, con ¬ scious of your desects, to accept the impor ¬ tant office of <humanprod>President</humanprod>, when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your <loc>country</loc> are depending, it would th my opinion, amount to a crime.
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the head of a party devoted to the enemies of <loc>America</loc>, and a party created for her ruin.

<time>T HE first number of the <org>AMERICAN FARMER</org>, was issued on the <time>2d of April 1819</time>.
It may now be announced as an es tablisbed National work, adapted to all the varieties of our climate, since many oi the most eminent citizens in all the <loc>states</loc>, con tribute by their patronage and their pens, to its circulation and its usefulness To make known all discoveries in the sci ence, and all improvements in the practice of <humanprod>Agriculture</humanprod> and <humanprod>Domestic Economy</humanprod>—and to develope the means and designate plans of internal improvements generally, consti tute the chief objects to which the <org>American Farmer</org> is devoted.
It takes no concern or interest in <org>party</org> politics, nor in the transient occurrences of the day.
The <pers>Farmer</pers> is published weekly, on.
- heel the size of a large <HumanProd>newspaper</HumanProd>, and folded o as to make eight pages—and to ad ¬ mit of being conveniently bound up and preserved in volumes.
Each volume will consist of fifty - two numbers, a title page and an index ; and numerous Engravings to re ¬ present new implements, and approved sys ¬ tems of husbandry Each number gives a true and accurate statement of the th * m selling prices of coun ¬ try produce, live stock and all tbe principal articles brought for sale in the <loc>Baltimore</loc> market.

But for the'' <HumanProd>Urn</HumanProd> of five dollars, the actual receipt of eve ¬ ry number is guaranteed.
That, is, when numbers fail to come to hand, duplicates shall be sent until every number shalljiave been received.
As the <pers>Editor</pers> takes the risk and cost of die mail—should subscription money mis ¬ carry, he holds himself, nevertheless, bound to furnish the paper.
To those who may think the price of sub ¬ scription too high, it may be remarked, that on a comparison ol their actual contents, one volume of the <HumanProd>American Farmer</HumanProd>, will be found to containas much as four volumes ol the <HumanProd>Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of Philadelphia</HumanProd> and the four volumes of that I patriotic, and exceedingly valuable work, sell for 12 dollars.
To shew that the <loc>American</loc> <humanprod>Farmer</humanprod>, is conducted in a manner to answer the great national purpose for which it was * stablish - ed.

From a letter received in this <loc>place</loc> from a <pers>gentleman</pers> of intelligence, and from our exchange papers which come to us from different sections of the <loc>country</loc>, we have the utmost assurance in saying that the <humanprod>Indian cause</humanprod> is gaining ground.
There is a great excitement on this sub ¬ ject and this excitement is extending.
Meetings have been held in <loc>New York</loc>, <loc>Philadelphia</loc>, <loc>New Haven</loc> and <loc>Hartford</loc>, and memorials to <org>Congress</org> adopted—oth ¬ er meetings ill other places will be held.
From the abstract of the debate in the <loc>House of Representatives</loc>, on the question of referring the <loc>New York</loc> memorial to the <org>Committee on Indian Adairs</org>, which our readers will find in another part of our paper, there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of <org>Congress</org>,
<loc>Washington</loc>, <time>January 25, 1830</time> - Gentlemen.
Your letter of the <time>I8ih</time> has been re ¬ ceived.
We feel highly gratified to learn, that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable meeting in <loc>New - York</loc>, against the violation of ’ he trea ¬ ties with the <humanprod>Cherokee</humanprod> and other na ¬ tions of <humanprod>Indians</humanprod>, meets your approba ¬ tion.
In vindicating the sacred right of the <loc>citizen</loc> to petition government on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respec ¬ table meeting of our fellow <loc>citizens</loc>, on a subject involving the faith of the <loc>nation</loc>, its honor and character ; and the existence of a race of men.
now the remnant of a one powerful <org>nation</org> ; we did no more than perform a duty ■ incumbent on us.
as the representa ¬ tives of a free <loc>people</loc>.
We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration, of what we said on the interesting occasion to which you re ¬ fer.
We are, most lespectfully, Your obedient servants, <pers>A SPENCER HENRY R. STORRS</pers>.
From the <loc>Chariest</loc> - n <HumanProd>Mercury</HumanProd>.
Nothing is doing now in <loc>Congress</loc>, in the lower <org>House</org>, but making mouths, blackguard ¬ ing, doubling fists, &.

It is sup ¬ posed that the decent members will not at ¬ tempt business until the rowdies have ex ¬ hausted themselves—or the <loc>House</loc> been purged after a general knock down and drag out.
There has as yet been no bloodshed, except a little scratching and hair - pulling iu the <loc>lobby</loc>.
The <org>Senate</org> has done some busi ¬ ness, has passed the <humanprod>Sub - Treasury Bill</humanprod>, and seems inclined to be decent, though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock up the sand scene ’ good as you sir, ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir, ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — afiiiir between an old and young one, <pers>Messrs. Clay</pers> aud <pers>Walk ¬ er</pers> tother day - Why will 31 r.
<pers>Clay</pers> disturb the harmony of the <loc>Senate</loc>, and rutile ( lie even current of his unaspiring course by such discordant scrapes?
From the <loc>Otmndagiia</loc> ( <org>N. A</org>. ) Standard.
The plan for disciplining the militia, pro ¬ posed by <pers>Mr. poinsett</pers>, w ould cost only half a million of dollars annually ; while that proposed by <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers>, with the present number ot our militia, would cost about FOUR MIL ¬ LIONS OF DOLLARS aunually.
<pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> proposed to place the whole force, brought under discipline on his system, distinctly w ithin the control of the <pers>President</pers>.
On the <time>3d of February</time> last, <pers>Gen. Ilarrisou</pers> addressed a letter to the “ <org>Louisville Legion</org>, ” in which he mentioned the plan here brought to view as one ofhis principal efforts to im ¬ prove the discipline ofthe militia.
And furthermore, <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> ’ s keepers have assured the public, that his sentiments have undergone “ no change. ”
Of course, then, <pers>Gen. Harrison</pers> would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official statiou, if placed in the <loc>Presidential chair</loc>, the odious and oppressively burthen - some scheme proposed by him iu a report to <org>Congress</org>.
Now, when the Western State Journal de ¬ nounces <pers>Gen.Harrison</pers> splan for organizing the militia, tho world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by <pers>Mr. Poinsett</pers>, and which has never received ihe approval of <pers>Mr. Yan</pers>!

From the <loc>Pennsylvanian</loc>.
<loc>Harrisburg</loc>, <time>June 26, 1840</time>.
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the <time>17th</time> iust.
, as well as another let ¬ ter of similar import, dated <time>16th inst</time>.
, tender ¬ ing to me a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you, just on the eve of my depar ¬ ture from <loc>Philadelphia</loc>.
It is a matter of re ¬ gret to me, that <time>time</time>, and my other indispen ¬ sable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered hospitality Allow mo to return my warmest thanks for the “ high regard and esteem ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meri ¬ torious <humanprod>services</humanprod>.
” I cannot, and I ought not to suppose, that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have dis ¬ tinguished the history of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her government, every official act I may find it necessary to perform, and every recommendation I may feel called on to make, should meet with unanimous approval.
It would be as unreason ¬ able as it w ’ ould be vain to look for this.
Some of the questions that have agitated <loc>Penn ¬ sylvania</loc>, and required my action upon them, are among the most intricate and perplexed iu the whole science of government, aud have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion, in the minds of the wisest and best men in this, aud other countries.
How, then, can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours, where habit, feeling, interest aud intelligence are so variously di ¬ versified and combined in their influence upon different individuals?
At the <time>time</time> when the executive functions of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> passed into my hands, I found them beset with difficulties on all sides.
An overwhelming public debt—the interest seini - anuually falling due upon it—a stupen ¬ dous system of public improvements disjoint ¬ ed and unfinished—a banking system, involv ¬ ing an enormous amount of incorporated capital, directly or indirectly connected with the most ofthe business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details iudubitable proofs of its uusoiindness and imperfection—the banking institutions strug ¬ gling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprizo paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended, and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow, without knowing wheii it would fall, or on what portion with the great ¬ est weight.
Such were some of the porten ¬ tous embarrassments encountered at the out ¬ set of my <pers>ollicial career</pers>, and the worst evils they portended have been fully realized.
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise, and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the <loc>people</loc>, according to my solemn convictions of out ) ', and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost responsibility of my station.
<pers>I</pers> assert no claim to infallibility or judgment, or to a share ef wisdom superior to others, but to undeviatiug houesty of purpose <pers>I</pers> do avow that <pers>I</pers> have a title, of which no human power can deprive me.
Forming ps the Executive does, but a por ¬ tion ofthe Legislative power of this common ¬ wealth, he is often reduced to the unavoida ¬ ble necessity, of sanctioning measures which do not iu all respects meet his approbation, or to prevent, by refusing such sauetiou, any legislation on the subject at all.
Iu several Distances I have found myself in this dilem ¬ ma, when my only choice was, between the two evils of an imperfect law, and no'egisla - tive action whatever.
<pers>I</pers> such cases <pers>I</pers> have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none, and have generally yielded my assent, even though <pers>I</pers> had objections to some parts of the law.
7 ’ he lato <humanprod>resolutions</humanprod> providing for the <time>time</time> of resuming specie payments by the <org>batiks</org> was one of this description.
I thought at the <time>time</time> and still think tha <time>day</time> fixed was too remote, hut I believed the permanent in ¬ terests of the community required that a <time>day</time> should be designated as speedily as possible for that event, and if it was not so grossly un ¬ reasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the <time>time</time> uncertain aud indefinite, I should uot prevent it becomiug a law.
It was, moreover, a subject on which the <org>Legislature</org> had deliberated for months, and the'fixing the precise day on which it should take place, being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle, a decent re ¬ spect for the opinions of the people ’ s repre ¬ sentatives, a majority of whom, in both bran ¬ ches, were elected by men of my own politi ¬ cal faith, seemed to forbid the propriety of in ¬ terposin'* the negative power, with which the <org>constitution</org> had clothed the <org>Executive</org>.
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best, in whatever aspect it could be viewed.
Accord inw to the theory and practice of our <org>govern¬ment</org>, legislation is a matter of compromise on inostlmbjects.
<org>No one co - ordinate de ¬ partment</org> has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar seutiments, on the part ofthe others.
<org>None</org> that either can do, is to take care that none of its essential prin ¬ ciples of constitutional construction, or public policy, shall be violated by the others ; when that is done, the remaining circle of duties cau be performed in a spirit of mutual conces - [ sion and compromise.
This is the doctrine of the <loc>constitution</loc>, the voice of the <org>people</org>, and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the <org>government</org> in harmony and goodwill.
7 ’ his principle affords the expla ¬ nation of my approval of more measures than one, against portions of which I had objec ¬ tions ; aud it is the only pretext on avhich the Legislature has refused or omitted to sanction recommendatjous of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this <loc>commonwealth</loc>.
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the <org>Legislature</org> on this subject, and it is fof the public to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the <org>Legis ¬ lature</org>, or that body right in refusing to adopt them.
I am gratified, however, in this, that iu most of the views embodied iu my recom ¬ mendations, the majority of the <org>House of Re - pi eseutatives</org> coincided with me in opinion, aud a number of the <org>Democratic</org> members of the <org>Senate</org>.
They failed, however, of success, and the remedy is in the hands of the people, if they approve of those measures, at the next <time>election</time>.
If they do not, whatever consequen ¬ ces follow, I have done my duty.
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this <loc>commonwealth</loc>, it will be found, I think, that though much has been left undone, « great deal has been accomplished.
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements, sustaining the faith and credit of the <loc>state</loc>, and terminating the present dis ¬ astrous suspension of specie payments, with provision which secures the public agaiust ar like recurrence in future, under a forfeiture of their charters by the <org>banks</org> ; and so far as de ¬ pends on me, will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced.
<HumanProd>7'he improvement bill</HumanProd>, it is univer ¬ sally admitted, coutains less objectionable matter than can be fouud in any prior legis ¬ lation on that subject.
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance ^ that the long practiced system of log - rolling, which has impoverished our <loc>treasury</loc> to the amount of some millions, is at an end.
<time>7</time> he precise nature ofthe difficulties we have labored under, in achieving this much, can only be learned by those who examine with care and caudor into our real condition.
All the pecuniary responsibilities, as well as the re ¬ sources of <loc>Pensylvania</loc>, must be taken into the account, in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued.
YY ’ <pers>e</pers> must take things as they are.
YY'e cannot retrieve wbat was done by our predecessors ; and those who expect us fr > act as if <loc>Pencj - lrnnia</loc> had no pub ¬ lic debt to provide for, uo unfinished improve ¬ ments to complete, no public interests to be protected, betray an ignorance of our true sit ¬ uation that entitles either the censure or their praise to very little regard.
7'he favorable o - piuiun of those, who, like the gentlemen I ad ¬ dress, are familiar with the true interests of the citizens of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc>, is a gratifying en ¬ couragement to the public man.
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed, those who understand what the best interests of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them.
Even though those endeavors should not in all mi ¬ nute respects correspond with their own pe ¬ culiar sentiments.
Differing iu mere matters of detail, I feel convinced that iu all the great principles of public policy, the <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> entertaius but one fun ¬ damental system of opinion.
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good government.
Recent experience has confirmed this opiuion, and assured me that <time>time</time> and <humanprod>experieuce</humanprod> are the great champions of the <org>democratic</org> cause.
I trust the recent aud existing embarrassments of our situation and the means to obviate them, will clearly illustrate this truth.
I am certain that <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> surrounded as she has been by difficulties on all hands, cau aud will be soon extricated, — that all evils complained of will be corrected, — abuses reformed, - — her contracts fulfilled, and every duty of government be faithfully performed, without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> has ever held dear.
Please accept, gentlemen, for yourselves individually, the assurauce of my high regard and consideration.

Dear Sir : The promiueut attitude which you now occupy in relation to the coining <loc>Residential</loc> contest, confers upon every voter o! this widely extended <loc>Republic</loc>, how ¬ ever humble may be his condition, a right to inquire your views upon each one of those momentous questions which now agitate the public mind.
Prompted, not by an impertinent curiosity, but solely by a desire ot ascertaining, whether your views or those of <pers>General Harrison</pers> co ¬ incide more nearly w ith ‘our own, we are in ¬ duced to propound to you the following ques ¬ tions, viz
: 1. AY ill you, it re - elected President, veto any bill having for its object, the abolition of slavery in the <loc>District of Columbia</loc> ; or would you sanction any bill granting appropriations o! the public money, to any <loc>State</loc>, soliciting aid for the emancipation of iheir slaves?
2. Do you think that, at this <time>time</time>, the safe ¬ ty of the public money requires a re - charter - ing of the <org>United States Bank</org> ; or would you sign a bill chartering such an institution?
3. Are you in favor of preserving entire the <HumanProd>Tariff Compromise</HumanProd>
?
4. YA ould you sanction any bill granting appropriations of the public money, for the purposes of internal improvement, by means of <humanprod>canals</humanprod>, <humanprod>railroads</humanprod>, $ ; c.
I 5. Do you approve of <pers>NIr Poinsett</pers> ’ s scheme for the organization of the militia?
J he preceding questions have been pro ¬ posed to <pers>Nlr Harrison</pers>.
Ut - lieving their de ¬ cision to be of vital impoitance to the interests and iu - titntions ot the <loc>South</loc>, and hoping you ‘ Day conceive them to be of such consequence, as to rnci - t an answer, A A e are respectfully, Your obedient servants, <pers>JOHN</pers> I?

THE <loc>HEW COUNTY BRIDGE</loc> AND <loc>* SCHOOL</loc>, <loc>HOUSE</loc>.
Tlie new county bridge over the <loc>James river</loc>, just south of <loc>town</loc>, is completed and ready for public patronage.
Its entire length is 160 <HumanProd>leet</HumanProd>, and its substruction is built of 12x12 <HumanProd>timbers</HumanProd>, with a covering 16 <HumanProd>leet</HumanProd> wide, made of 7 inch <HumanProd>plank</HumanProd>, with a railing 3 feet high on each side.
The bridge was constructed by <pers>Peter Auberton</pers> of this <loc>city</loc>.
<pers>Mr. Auberton</pers> also took the ^ contract for building the village school house for this place, which he expects to have done by the <time>first of February</time>.
The school <HumanProd>building</HumanProd> is 30x42, 28 feet high above the stone <HumanProd>foundation</HumanProd>—which stands 2 feet above the ground There is a <HumanProd>partition</HumanProd>, cutting off 12 feet from the front of th ^ the <HumanProd>building</HumanProd>, to be used for a <HumanProd>stairway</HumanProd> and <HumanProd>entry room</HumanProd>, leaving the <HumanProd>school room</HumanProd> on the first floor 30 feet square.
The front porch which faces toward the <loc>south</loc>, is 8x12, and gracefully ornamented with different kinds of scroll work.
The <HumanProd>cupola</HumanProd> or <HumanProd>belfry</HumanProd>, is 8 feet square and very neatly finished.
The height from the top of the flag staff on the <loc>cupola</loc> to the ground is 62 feet high.
The structure is in every way first class, and cost about <HumanProd>$3000</HumanProd>.
<pers>Mr. Auberton</pers> bos done a great deal of work for <loc>Stutsman county</loc>, having built the court house early in the fall, and we understand that bis work has thus far given entire satisfaction.
<HumanProd>A Bit oT Daring</HumanProd>.
A Western paper tells the story of <pers>Steve Venard</pers> ’ s fight with three rob ¬ bers in <time>1866</time>.
The stage coming to <loc>Nevada</loc>, <pers>Col.</pers>
, had been robbed by three <humanprod>men</humanprod>, and the <humanprod>treasure - box</humanprod> taken.
A party set out for its recovery.
<pers>Yenard</pers>, armed with a <humanprod>Henry rifle</humanprod>, followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rug ¬ ged region.
The <loc>hills</loc> hung steep above.
The waters of the <loc>ravine</loc> came tumbling down its steep bed of bowl ¬ ders with a rush and a noise which ren ¬ dered no other sounds audible.
<pers>Yenard</pers> attempted to cross the stream at the head of the fall.
He walked on a short <loc>log</loc> to a <loc>rock</loc>.
Above him rose the huge mass of <loc>granite</loc>, buttressed in front by two smaller <loc>rocks</loc>.
Between these latter was an alley which led to the base of the <loc>Titan</loc>.
His position was suen as to look up the <loc>alley</loc>.
At the base of the great rock <loc>Yenard</loc> discov ¬ ered the leader of the gang sit ¬ ting on the ground drawing his revolver.
<pers>Venard</pers> leveled his rifle upon the robber, twenty feet distant.
At the same time he saw an ¬ other of the gang pointing at him over the edge of a <loc>rock</loc>.
There was no <time>time</time> to change his aim.
He fired ; the <pers>leader</pers> fell back, shot through the heart.
The other robber attempted to shield him self farther behind a <loc>rock</loc>, leaving the point of his pistol exposed over the top.
<pers>Venard</pers> covered the spot with his unerring <humanprod>Henry</humanprod>, and when the head of the robber peered over the top hi3 brain was pierced with a bullet.
There was yet another, but he was not to be seen.
His pistol might at that mo ¬ ment be pointing at <pers>Yenard</pers>.
The latter clambered up to beard him in his den.
He found the <HumanProd>treasure</HumanProd>, took the <HumanProd>pistols</HumanProd> from the dead, covered quickly the former with earth and leaves, and proceeded to hunt the missing <HumanProd>robber</HumanProd>.
He found him running up the <loc>mount ain</loc>, sixty yards or more ahead.
<pers>Ve ¬ nard</pers> fired and the robber fell.
Another bullet, and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead.
<org>TUB SCHOOL BOARD</org> : Just what our school board propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear, but it ia safe to predict that no lady teacher will get the school.
The majority of the board are very much opposed to such an arrangement, and so long as they are our people have but little to fear from them in that direction.
W « <org>believe that the board</org> desire to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the people.
<pers>Mr. Lees</pers>, as well as <pers>Mr. McKechnie</pers>, stated to us not long since, that they would not in any degree favor the in ¬ stallment of a lady teacher, but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests ot the people.
We do not oppose the hiring of a lady teacher because we are particularly preju ¬ diced against them, for we are not, and believe that some of the most reliable and able teachers that bless our <loc>land</loc> to - day are ladies.
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present, and we are of the opinion that we cannot, could a lady teacher, with no more than ordinary abili ¬ ty do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the <loc>county</loc> will agree with us when we answer most emphatically, no.
If our <loc>county</loc> was able to stand the extra ex ¬ pense we would be In favor of hiring two teachers instead of one.
Could we see our way clear in this direction we would then favor the engagement of a lady teacher whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department, leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the haads of a capable gentle ¬ man teacher.
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against <pers>Mrs. Shoe ¬ maker</pers>, and en that account are opposed to her being engaged is basely false.
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately, in regard to <pers>Mrs. Shoemaker</pers> which would in any way convey the idea that we are personally prejudiced against her.
We are not in favor of <pers>her</pers> teaching the <loc>school</loc> for the same reasons that we would oppose any other lady teacher who might be endeavoring to get it.
A little over a year ago the <pers>Stur ¬ geon Lendcr</pers> published a very sensa ¬ tional account of the marriage of <pers>Miss Nettie White</pers> to <pers>Robt</pers>.
<pers>L. Winn</pers>.
<pers>Miss White</pers> at the time, was engaged to both <pers>Chas</pers>.
and <pers>Robt</pers>.
<pers>Winn</pers>, two brothers, but had much difficulty in deciding which of her lovers was the wbichest.
<pers>Robt</pers>.
, however, proved to be the successful suitor.
The young couple recently agreed to dis ¬ agree, and the faithless <pers>Robt</pers>.
left for <loc>Texas</loc>, and the young wife re ¬ turned to the home of her parents, and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant <pers>spouse</pers> upon the grounJs of desertion.
The pros ¬ pects for a re - hearing for the dis ¬ consolate <pers>Charles</pers>, who has spent the intervening time in repining, are growing very bright, as the young lady now declares that she really loved <pers>Charles</pers> best in tbe first place.
The firm of <org>Geo</org>.
<org>D. Barnard iSr Co.</org>, of <loc>St. Louis</loc>, a firm which some officials in this county give a great many orders for letter beads, envel -'opes and such other blanks as could be furnished by the printing offices in this county, arc all Republicans, but <pers>Mr. Keene</pers>, their traveling sales ¬ man in this territory, we understand, is a Democrat.
We have been in ¬ formed, upon good authority, that <org>Messrs. Barnard & Co.</org> are not uni ¬ form in their prices.
For instance, ’ a certain blank book they have beer * known to sell in <loc>Montgomery county</loc> for $17.
In <loc>St. Charles county</loc> they place “ a tariff ” of SI ', on the same book, and in <loc>Lincoln county</loc> the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from ” $21 for the very same book.
We presume their prices arc made in proportion to the number of <HumanProd>pocket - knives</HumanProd>, <HumanProd>gold pens</HumanProd>, etc., they give away to capture an order.
If <org>Democratic</org> county of ¬ ficials will send their orders abroad for job work, let them, at least, pat ¬ ronize <org>Democratic</org> firms.
<HumanProd>Curiosities of the Postage Stamp</HumanProd>.
There are about 6,000 varieties of <humanprod>postage stamps</humanprod> now iu use by the different nations of the <loc>world</loc>.
The museum of the <loc>Berlin</loc> post - cfllce alone contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens, half of which are European and the remain ¬ der divided between the <loc>Americans</loc>, <loc>Asia</loc>, <loc>Africa</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc>.
The emblems upon the stamps of <loc>nations</loc> are legion ; the <loc>earth</loc>, the <loc>sea</loc> and the vaulted canopy above have been ransacked for curious and mraning less devices and legends.
The entire animal kingdom, the stars and the moon in all its phases, besides legendary emblems by the thousand, are known to the collectors of stamps, who pride themselves upon being “ <HumanProd>philatelists</HumanProd>. ”
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be found * } the fogies of five <pers>emperors</pers>, eighteen <pers>kings</pers>, three <pers>queens</pers>, one <pers>grand duke</pers>, several inferior titled rulers and many <pers>presidents</pers>.
<pers>M. Pliillippe de Ferrari</pers> perhaps has the largest and most valuable collec ¬ tion of stamps in the world, amount ¬ ing to something like 2ft0,000, and within tbe present year he solJ one little stamp to a collector in <loc>Paris</loc> for 150.000.
In <loc>England</loc> and other parts of <loc>Europe</loc>, horseshoes are now in use, made of cowhide instead of iron.
The shoe is composed of three thick ¬ nesses of the <HumanProd>hide</HumanProd> which is pressed into a solid <HumanProd>steel</HumanProd> mould and after ¬ ward treated by a chemical process.
It is said to be far superior, in sev ¬ eral particulars, to the <HumanProd>iron shoe</HumanProd>.

which reads in part, as follows : " <HumanProd>Grain</HumanProd> has done exceptionally well, being well filled, and I see no reason why It should not be extensively and success ¬ fully grown here.
As far as my obser ¬ vations go.
the climate here is as suit ¬ able for raising winter wheat as in any place in the northwestern or the north ¬ ern states of <loc>America</loc>.
From my ex ¬ perience of the last <time>two years</time>.
1 see no reason why this <loc>country</loc> should not be able to produce its owu vegetables and grains.
As for flowers, the success I have had proves that all hardy annuals will do well.
The coming <time>year</time> I in ¬ tend planting several hundred hybrid <humanprod>roses</humanprod>, also summer flowering <humanprod>bulbs</humanprod>, a large variety of other hardy and half - hardy <humanprod>annuals</humanprod>, and some of the hardy <humanprod>perennials</humanprod>.
Small fruit, such as <HumanProd>strawberries</HumanProd>.

The <HumanProd>Shirt Waist</HumanProd>.
Very inviting are the displays of <HumanProd>Ox ¬ fords</HumanProd>, <HumanProd>cheviots</HumanProd>, <HumanProd>zephyrs</HumanProd> and <HumanProd>madras</HumanProd> cloths for the shirt waist, and the made - up models have already pushed out of place their winter representa ¬ tives in cloth, velvet and fine <HumanProd>llannels</HumanProd>.
We shall wear the comfortable <humanprod>wools</humanprod>, aye, and even buy them for some <time>time</time> to come, but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the thinner suc ¬ cessors.
A pretty feature in the wash waist for next <time>summer</time> is their sim ¬ plicity.
The <HumanProd>human form divine</HumanProd> is to have a chance to breathe once more, for the voluminous starchy fronts arc no more.
Even those professing to be loose have no surplus material, and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain, fitted over shoulders and bust and buttoned simply down the back.
<HumanProd>Red dotted swiss</HumanProd> has the entire front crossed In diamonds ^ of white val insertion, the undarted front Just puck ¬ ered a little at the belt, the plain back closed with bullet - shaped pearl buttons.
The close sleeves have a tight cult, and the simple, unlined col ¬ lar has little oblong turnovers of <loc>Swiss</loc> and <loc>Valenciennes</loc> lace.
Another style for these <HumanProd>buttou - up - the - back waists</HumanProd> Is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting.
<HumanProd>Ibis</HumanProd> Is of the styte which is purchased ready tucked and joined, and saves infinite labor, besides being nicer than the most careful home seamstress could make it.
<HumanProd>Madras waists</HumanProd>, aiso so fastened, have a slender - rest of tucking, running down to a point at the waist, and have little re - vers from the neck f o the bust on each side.
These are also of tucking and simply finished with a frill of narrow <HumanProd>lace</HumanProd>.
Large collars and full, fussy re - vers are not shown at all.
There is every evidence that the <time>1900</time> summer girl proposes, above all, to be sweetly cleanly.
Her <humanprod>waists</humanprod> say plainly enough that it will be a simple matter to wash and Iron them, and there need be no lack In their number for that reason.
One feature which marks them ns new and far prettier than the old <HumanProd>shirt waists</HumanProd> is the entire absence of yokes of any kind, even In the back.
The only semblance of a <HumanProd>yoke</HumanProd> is the one which is trimmed and applied to the shoulders, forming a little <HumanProd>epaulet</HumanProd> over the sleeves.
The backs of the semi ¬ full front <HumanProd>waists</HumanProd> are tucked and plaited to correspond with the front.
There are stiff linen cuffs, with rounded cor ¬ ners and detachable collars, which can be discarded altogether for the more becoming <HumanProd>stocks</HumanProd>, and long <HumanProd>silk scarfs</HumanProd> tied twice around the neck.

<HumanProd>FOREIGN WORDS</HumanProd>.
<org>Soma General Rule</org> * That Will Aid In Pro ¬ nouncing Them.
Many foreign words have become a part of the <loc>English</loc> language through frequent use and It Is wise and proper to pronounce them according to rules of <loc>English</loc>.
There are, on the other hand, ninny words that do not readily lend themselves to the <loc>English</loc> style of pronunciation, or that are not used often enough to warrant it.
In pro ¬ nouncing such words the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the foreign languages.
In <loc>Latin</loc> two vowels are not put In one syllable unless they are joined as a diphthong.
There are as many syl ¬ lables as there are vowels in a word.
( Si'- ne di'- e for sine die. » In German, the letter w has tlie sound of v in English. ( <HumanProd>Vahg' - ner</HumanProd> for <HumanProd>Wagner</HumanProd>. )
Tlie same is true in <loc>French</loc>, though w is only found in words that have been borrowed from other lan ¬ guages.
The letter i in <loc>German</loc> and in the <humanprod>Latin tongues</humanprod>, viz : <loc>French</loc>, <loc>Italian</loc> and <loc>Spanish</loc> lias tlie sound of long e.
( <humanprod>Peek</humanprod> for <humanprod>pique</humanprod>, Fr. : <humanprod>Bee</humanprod>'- an - ko for <humanprod>Bianco</humanprod>, It. ; I > ee'- os for <humanprod>Dios</humanprod>, Sp. )
In the <loc>Latin</loc> tongues, also, the letter a generally, though not always has the broad sound, while the letter o has the long sound.
Tlie letter c in <loc>Itali</loc> : n when fol ¬ lowed by e or i 1ms the sound of eh.
( <loc>Viu</loc>'- cliee for <org>Vinci</org>. )
Final consonants in <loc>French</loc> are nearly always silent.
( <pers>Pah</pers> for <pers>Pas</pers>. )
So also is final <humanprod>e</humanprod> silent unless, an accent mark is placed above it.
The aecentiMl e has the sound of long a in <loc>English</loc> or a sound quite close to that.
The syllables in <loc>French</loc> words are never accented as in <loc>English</loc> words.
<HumanProd>them</HumanProd> are supposed to receive equal emphasis, but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into tlie next word us is often done.
The <loc>French</loc> make frequent use of nasal vowels, so - called, the correct pronunciation of which'o difficult to acquire.
The nasal vowel is composed of a vowel and a consonant—<HumanProd>m</HumanProd> or <HumanProd>n</HumanProd>.
The consonant is practicelly silent, but serves to give tlie nasal tone to the vowel.
The pronunciation of the word <HumanProd>salon</HumanProd>, ( for example ) as given In <org>Web¬ster’s</org> dictionary.
Is <loc>sa - loug</loc> '.
It should be observed that in the front of the <HumanProd>dictionary</HumanProd> it is explicitly stated that this ng is silent, being used only to convey the idea of tin * nasal sound.

Why does <loc>Great Britian</loc> buy its oatmeal of us?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to <loc>Newcastle</loc> to speak of exjxirt - ing oatmeal to <loc>Scotland</loc> and yet, every year the <org>Quaker Oats Company</org> sends hundreds of thousands of cases of <humanprod>Quaker Oats</humanprod> to <loc>Great Britian</loc> and <loc>Europe</loc>, The reason is simple ; while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically, and active mentally of all people, the American has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade.
How well he has succeeded would be seen at a glance at the export re ¬ ports on <org>Quaker Oats</org>.
This <HumanProd>brand</HumanProd> is recognized as without a rival in clean ¬ liness and delicious flavor.

<org>CRIMSON CLOVER</org> I had a short article in last week ’ s <org>Herald</org> on the importance of <humanprod>crimson clover</humanprod>, and I have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil.
Now.
I am not acquainted with all the farmers who have grown crimson clover ’ in <loc>Putnam county</loc> and 1 wish I was.
I would have a great many more short articles published, but to any one who has grown this crotp and feels like recommending it to his farmer frieds please write a short piece and send to me or the <org>Herald</org> with your name signed, so we can see who has had the experience.
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of <HumanProd>crimson clover</HumanProd> : First, prepare - the seed bed well.
Make the seed / bed as for <HumanProd>wheat</HumanProd> or <HumanProd>clover</HumanProd> and sow 15 to 20 lbs.
of se6d to the acre and if there has be n other clover grown on the land recently inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise Inoculation should be ap ¬ plied.
.
Either get some soil from <loc>clover field</loc> or get the liquid inocula ¬ tion and inoculate the seed before sowing, but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the bright sunlight.
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in ’ the <loc>shade</loc> to dry and then sow in the <time>early morning</time> or in the <time>evening</time> or on.
a cloudy day with the <HumanProd>harrow</HumanProd> followig the seeding.
In this way the inoculation is ffectlve.
Apply when seeding <HumanProd>cromson clover</HumanProd> some 15 per cent acid phosphate from 100 to 300 pounds to the acre.
Tn this way the <HumanProd>clover</HumanProd> gets a good growth and the better the <HumanProd>clover</HumanProd> grows the more nitrogen it gathers and stores in.
the soil, consequently the better crop you get following the <HumanProd>crimson clover</HumanProd>.
* If you are sowing for a pasture and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of <HumanProd>rye</HumanProd> with the <HumanProd>crimson clover</HumanProd>.
It will fur ¬ nish more pasture and help to hold the <HumanProd>clover</HumanProd>.
<loc></loc>Hoping to see your testimony of growing crimson clover in the paper next week, if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow, let us hear from you.

CLEARING UP THE <loc>EDENTON</loc> CENSUS COUNT <loc>Edentonians</loc> have been raising quite a squawk over the census re ¬ turns, They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their! duties, that the carriers beak ; cf the <loc>Edcnton</loc> <org>postoffice</org> show that the <org>postoffice</org> serves approximate ¬ ly 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they arc clamoiing for a new enumeration.
In the efTia * of the <loc>District Supervisor of Census</loc>, this is cla.
<org>Chamber of Commerce</org> and press <humanprod>ballyhoo</humanprod>.
Residents of <loc>Edenton</loc> have been boasting ‘ for several years that the population of their town was more than 5,000 J when the official count revealed only 3.519. Residents of <loc>Edenton</loc> were disappointed and began to grumble. Several s * dulous busybodies, anxious to boost the population of their town, borrowed the carrier ’ s books from the <loc>postofTice</loc> and counted all the names therein. They found nearly 4.500 names in the books. And immediately a cry was raised. ‘ Wc want, a new tabulation. There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us. "
Bui it was just so much hokum, in the opinion of a representative of the <loc>District Supervisor</loc>'s office. If <loc>Edentonians</loc> fooled themselves Into believing that <loc>Edenton</loc>'s population is ever the 4.000 mark, they didn't succeed in fooling anyone else. When a person or a family moves to a town, the name is placed in the car ¬ rier's bock. But. when they leave town, their names are not struck off the boc! ;. Go everyone who moved to <loc>Edenton</loc> from <time>1920</time> to <time>1930</time> was ugislucd in the postofTice carriers lyckx, and the names of everyone v, ho moved from <loc>Edenton</loc> in that ■ ■ pried of time were not removed from the bocks. <loc>Edentonians</loc> even wonted to in -'elude in the <loc>Edenton</loc> census count the names of all <loc>Edentonians</loc>'work ¬ ing away from <loc>Edenton</loc>, but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by <pers>Uncle Sam</pers>. So the official census of <loc>Edenton</loc> for the next decade will be 3,519. <loc>Edentonians</loc> ’ protests to the contrary notwithstanding.

<pers>Ala</pers>.
under the theme, “ <HumanProd>Girded for Progress a * Mid - Century</HumanProd>. ”
The opening meeting was called to order by <pers>Mrs. Chris ¬ tina Fuqua</pers>, president of <loc>De ¬ troit</loc>.
<pers>Mich</pers>., and opened with a solo by <pers>Mrs. Mattie S. Bibb</pers>.
<pers>Mrs. E. R. Naggles</pers>.
<org>Iota Phi Lambda sorority</org>, <org>Tuskegee Institute</org>, welcomed the Leagu.e to <loc>Tuskegee</loc>.
followed by a solo by <pers>Mrs. Willie M. Miller</pers> with <pers>Mrs. A. R Ashley</pers> as accomp - panist.
In addressing the <org>League</org>, <pers>Mrs. Fuqua</pers> explained the purpose of the <org>League</org>, its achievements and how it can function in a com ¬ munity.
knowing its <loc>national</loc> pos ¬ sibilities.
The <pers>president</pers> pointed out that women should be proud that they spend the “ must'* dollars ; that is. the dollar for the home and that they could help by being a part of the growing Negro busi ¬ nesses. She stated that pool - buying would help Negro busi ¬ nesses to expand. <pers>Horace Sudduth</pers>. <pers>president</pers> of the <org>National Negro Business League</org> stated in his address to the <org>Business and Housewives League</org> ; ‘ There is nothing that will build our neighborhood business ¬ es on a competitive basis faster than the program that has been carried on by the <org>Housewives League</org> for the past <time>17 years</time>. The effectiveness of this program has been proved wherever <org>Housewiv ¬ es Leagues</org> exist. We must have trong, functioning <org>Housewives Leagues</org> working side by side with every affiliated local league. We must carry them right along with us. As we grow strong, they will grow * strong. ”
<pers>Mrs. Fuqua</pers> urged all members and visitors of the fifteen states represented at the Convention who were engaged in new enter ¬ prises of manufacturing, to join the <org>league</org> or keep in touch with it in order that they may be pro ¬ moted.
Among the guests were : <pers>Mrs. H. F. Thomas</pers>.

<loc>Atlanta</loc>, <loc>Georgia</loc>..
a <HumanProd>fashion designer</HumanProd>.
