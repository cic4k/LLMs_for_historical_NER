In all the cases given above, except one or two which are specified, <ORG>O</ORG> has preserved the correct reading, and almost invariably sides with <ORG>L</ORG> against <ORG>A</ORG>.

The list of differences just given, in almost all of which <PERS>O</PERS> corrects <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s errors, clearly shows <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s family, but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of <PERS>O</PERS> ’ s original.
The many places where the text of <WORK>A</WORK> omits a word or is corrupt, but where <WORK>O</WORK> supplies the omission and confirms <WORK>L</WORK> and the correct text, show that <WORK>O</WORK> certainly represents the text of an earlier <DATE>date</DATE> than <WORK>A</WORK>, when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which <WORK>A</WORK> has gathered.
4. Certain corruptions are common to both <OBJECT>O</OBJECT> and <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>, and must have crept into the text of this family of the <OBJECT>MSS</OBJECT>. at a <DATE>date</DATE> considerably anterior to that of <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>.
The following is a list of all the errors common to <ORG>O</ORG> and <ORG>A</ORG>, which can be properly called errors of <ORG>A</ORG> ’ s family.

The form τρανός was current in later Greek ; the earliest instance seems to be <PERS>Dionys</PERS>. <WORK>Halic</WORK>. ( c. <DATE>25 B. C</DATE>. )
De <WORK>Comp. Verborum</WORK> c. 22 τρανὴν καὶ καθαρὰν δύναμιν. ἀλώμεθα : this fig. sense, with ref. to uncertainty ‘to be at sea, ’ as we say ), belongs nowhere else to this verb, but often to πλανᾶσθαι ( <PERS>Her.</PERS> 6. 37, etc. ; <PERS>Plat.</PERS> <WORK>Hipp. Ma.</WORK> 304 C πλανὦμοι μὲν καὶ ἀπορῷ ἀεί ).
24 <PERS>θελοντής</PERS>. The form <PERS>ἐθελοντής</PERS> occurs in <PERS>Herodotus</PERS>, <PERS>Thucydides</PERS>, <PERS>Xenophon</PERS>, and the <ORG>Orators</ORG>, as <PERS>ἐθελοντήρ</PERS> does in <WORK>Od</WORK>. <SCOPE>2. 292</SCOPE>.
On the other hand θελοντής is cited only from <PERS>Porphyrius</PERS> ( c. <DATE>270 A. D.</DATE>, see <PERS>Lobeck</PERS>, <WORK>Phrym</WORK>. <SCOPE>7</SCOPE> ) and <PERS>Hierocles</PERS> ( c. <DATE>450 A. D.</DATE> ), ἄρ. <WORK>Slob</WORK>. <WORK>For</WORK>. <SCOPE>75</SCOPE>. <SCOPE>14</SCOPE> ( p. <SCOPE>449</SCOPE>. <SCOPE>20</SCOPE> ).
Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by <PERS>Plato</PERS> ( <WORK>Crat.</WORK> <SCOPE>406 A</SCOPE> ), while the earliest authority for θελήμων is <PERS>Apoll.</PERS> <WORK>Rhod.</WORK> <SCOPE>2. 557</SCOPE>.
In ragio iambics θέλω was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to ἐθέλω, though the latter occurs n tragic anapaests ( as <WORK>O. T.</WORK> <SCOPE>1303</SCOPE>, <WORK>Ph.</WORK> <SCOPE>145</SCOPE> ).
If <WORK>θελοντής</WORK> were found in a pasage where metre reguiredit, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection.
But where, as here, aphaeresis was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote ἐθελοντής. — ὑπεῖύγην, as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself : cp. <WORK>P.</WORK> <SCOPE>1025</SCOPE> κλοπῇ τε κἀνάγκη ξυγείς ( n. )
<PERS>Aesch</PERS>. <WORK>P.</WORK> <WORK>P.</WORK> <SCOPE>108</SCOPE> ἀνάγκαις ταῖσδ ’ ὑπέζευγμαι.
26 t. κατηναρισμένας : for ἐναρίζω ‘to slay ’ ( properly with the further notion of ‘despoiling ’ ) cp. <WORK>O. C.</WORK> <SCOPE>1733</SCOPE>, <WORK>Tr.</WORK> <SCOPE>94</SCOPE>.
From the cognate form κατεναίρομαι we have κατήναρὲς in <WORK>Anmi</WORK>. <SCOPE>871</SCOPE>. - ἐς χερὸς, by a human <OBJECT>hand</OBJECT>.
The military sense, ‘at close quarters ’ ( <WORK>Ten. H.</WORK> <SCOPE>7. 2. 14</SCOPE> ἐνέβαλὸν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἐμάχοντο ), is less fitting here.
- αὐτοῖς ποιμνίον ἐπιστάταις ; cp. <SCOPE>fr. 873</SCOPE> αὐτοῖσιν ὅπλοις.
The idiom occurs in the <WORK>Iliad</WORK> ( as <SCOPE>8. 24</SCOPE> ), — sometimes with συν added ( as <SCOPE>14. 498</SCOPE> ), a form of it found also, though not often, in later poetry ( <PERS>Eur</PERS>. <WORK>Ion</WORK> <SCOPE>32</SCOPE> αὐτ ’ ξὺν ἄγγει ). — ἐπιστάταῖς, ‘overseers, ’ masters ’ or ‘guardians ’ of them ; as a warrior is ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης ( <PERS>Aesch</PERS>. <WORK>Prs</WORK>. <SCOPE>379</SCOPE> ), and a rower, ἐρετμῶν ( <PERS>Eur</PERS>. <WORK>Helen</WORK>. <SCOPE>1267</SCOPE> ).
Cp. <PERS>Eur</PERS>. fr. <SCOPE>188</SCOPE>. <SCOPE>4</SCOPE> σκάπτων, ἀρῶν γῆν, ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν. <SCOPE>28</SCOPE> πᾶς τις. The deed was found out at dawn.
Common rumour at once pointed to <PERS>Ajax</PERS>.
Then the ὀπτήρ ( <SCOPE>29</SCOPE> ) informed <PERS>Odysseus</PERS>, who reached the tent of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> very soon after the tatters return ; as is shown by <SCOPE>296 - 304</SCOPE> compared with
νέμει : cp. <WORK>Galea</WORK> <SCOPE>7. 582</SCOPE> ( <PERS>Kuhn</PERS> ) οὐκ ἴσην ἅπασι νέμει τὴν αἰτίαν. The corrupi τρέπει may have come from the glos on ἐκείνῳ.. νέμει which occurs in some of the later <OBJECT>MSS</OBJECT>., εἰς αὐτὸν τρέπει.
This is one of the few instances ( like <WORK>Ant</WORK>. <SCOPE>386</SCOPE> and <SCOPE>831</SCOPE> ) where a true reading, lost in <WORK>L</WORK>, has been preserved in other <WORK>MSs</WORK>. Cp. crit. notes on <SCOPE>44</SCOPE>, <SCOPE>61</SCOPE>.

‘What were these daring schemes, what was this rash ) confidence, with which he planned the attack? ’

<SCOPE>47</SCOPE> νύκτρ κ. τ. λ. : an answer to the last question : - he relied on darkness, and on craft ; and none shared his secret.

( Cp. <WORK>Pans</WORK>. <SCOPE>4. 19. 2</SCOPE> τὴν σκηνὴν τὴν στρατηγίδα. )
The phrase is equivalent, of course, to δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις.
<WORK>721 στρατήγιον</WORK>, n.
But, since there were two tents and two entrances, δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i. e., the literal sense is, ‘two doors of chiefs. ”
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent, so that only one entrance could be meant by πύλαις, then, indeed, δισσαῖς could be explained only as reforring to the subst. implied in στρατηγίσιν, “ the tent - door of two chiefs, ’ = δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις.
But such a use of <OBJECT>δισσαῖς</OBJECT> seems impossible.
Could δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα ( e. g. ) mean, ‘a <OBJECT>chariot</OBJECT> belonging to two <PERS>brothers</PERS> ’?
