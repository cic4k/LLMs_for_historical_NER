In all the cases given above, except one or two which are specified, <OBJECT>O</OBJECT> has preserved the correct reading, and almost invariably sides with <OBJECT>L</OBJECT> against <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>.
A few of <PERS>O</PERS>'s minor corrections of <PERS>A</PERS> are omitted ; 6, δ. in accent as <SCOPE>495</SCOPE>. τῶνδέ τοι : <SCOPE>628</SCOPE>, μεθεῖσά μοι, where <PERS>A</PERS> omits the acute accent : <SCOPE>779</SCOPE>. δε <PERS>O</PERS>. δεῖν᾽ <PERS>A</PERS> : <SCOPE>890</SCOPE>. μώραν <PERS>O</PERS>. μωρὰν <PERS>A</PERS> : <SCOPE>1433</SCOPE>.

3 - From this list of readings it is plain that <OBJECT>O</OBJECT> is a more correct <OBJECT>MS</OBJECT>. than <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>, and a fairer representative of the family of <OBJECT>MSS</OBJECT>. to which <OBJECT>A</OBJECT> belongs.
The list of differences just given, in almost all of which <PERS>O</PERS> corrects <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s errors, clearly shows <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s family, but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of <PERS>O</PERS> ’ s original.
The many places where the text of <WORK>A</WORK> omits a word or is corrupt, but where <WORK>O</WORK> supplies the omission and confirms <WORK>L</WORK> and the correct text, show that <WORK>O</WORK> certainly represents the text of an earlier date than <WORK>A</WORK>, when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which <WORK>A</WORK> has gathered.
4. Certain corruptions are common to both <OBJECT>O</OBJECT> and <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>, and must have crept into the text of this family of the <OBJECT>MSS</OBJECT>. at a date considerably anterior to that of <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>.
The following is a list of all the errors common to <OBJECT>O</OBJECT> and <OBJECT>A</OBJECT>, which can be properly called errors of <PERS>A</PERS> ’ s famiiy®.
A very few minor divergencies of accent and orthography are omitted.

The inactivity of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> was his manner of contending with the chiefs : if the rumour was true, it was an inactivity in which he had been fatally active ; and however his leisure was employed, it was becoming full of danger to him,
The force of ἀγών, in the sense of a dangerous contest, is therefore suited to the place, and the expression is an oxymoron, ‘ a perilous quarrelsome rest ’ ( for which, cp. <PERS>Shak.</PERS>. <WORK>Ant. and Cleo.</WORK> <SCOPE>1. 3</SCOPE>, < ’ Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart. )

Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by <PERS>Plato</PERS> ( <WORK>Crat.</WORK> <SCOPE>406 A</SCOPE> ), while the earliest authority for θελήμων is <PERS>Apoll. Rhod.</PERS> <WORK>2.</WORK> <SCOPE>557</SCOPE>.
In ragio iambics θέλω was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to ἐθέλω, though the latter occurs n tragic anapaests ( as <WORK>O. T.</WORK> <SCOPE>1303</SCOPE>, <WORK>Ph.</WORK> <SCOPE>145</SCOPE> ).
If <OBJECT>θελοντής</OBJECT> were found in a pasage where metre reguiredit, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection.
But where, as here, aphaeresis was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote ἐθελοντής. — ὑπεῖύγην, as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself : cp. <WORK>P</WORK>. <SCOPE>1025</SCOPE> κλοπῇ τε κἀνάγκη ξυγείς ( n. )

From the cognate form κατεναίρομαι we have κατήναρὲς in <WORK>Anmi</WORK>. <SCOPE>871</SCOPE>. - ἐς χερὸς, by a human hand.
The military sense, ‘at close quarters ’ ( <PERS>Ten</PERS>. <WORK>H</WORK>. <SCOPE>7. 2. 14</SCOPE> ἐνέβαλὸν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἐμάχοντο ), is less fitting here.
- αὐτοῖς ποιμνίον ἐπιστάταις ; cp. <WORK>fr</WORK>. <SCOPE>873</SCOPE> αὐτοῖσιν ὅπλοις.
The idiom occurs in the <WORK>Iliad</WORK> ( as <SCOPE>8. 24</SCOPE> ), — sometimes with συν added ( as <SCOPE>14. 498</SCOPE> ), a form of it found also, though not often, in later poetry ( <PERS>Eur</PERS>. <WORK>Ion</WORK> <SCOPE>32</SCOPE> αὐτ ’ ξὺν ἄγγει ). — ἐπιστάταῖς, ‘overseers, ’ masters ’ or ‘guardians ’ of them ; as a warrior is ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης ( <PERS>Aesch</PERS>. <WORK>Prs</WORK>. <SCOPE>379</SCOPE> ), and a rower, ἐρετμῶν ( <PERS>Eur</PERS>. <WORK>Helen</WORK>. <SCOPE>1267</SCOPE> ).

νέμει : cp. <WORK>Galea</WORK> <SCOPE>7. 582</SCOPE> ( <PERS>Kuhn</PERS> ) οὐκ ἴσην ἅπασι νέμει τὴν αἰτίαν. The corrupi τρέπει may have come from the glos on ἐκείνῳ.. νέμει which occurs in some of the later <OBJECT>MSS</OBJECT>., εἰς αὐτὸν τρέπει.

( Cp. <WORK>Pans</WORK>. <SCOPE>4. 19. 2</SCOPE> τὴν σκηνὴν τὴν στρατηγίδα. )
The phrase is equivalent, of course, to δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις.
<WORK>721 στρατήγιον</WORK>, n.
But, since there were two tents and two entrances, δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i. e., the literal sense is, ‘two doors of <PERS>chiefs</PERS>. ”
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent, so that only one entrance could be meant by πύλαις, then, indeed, δισσαῖς could be explained only as reforring to the subst. implied in στρατηγίσιν, “ the tent - door of two <PERS>chiefs</PERS>, ’ = δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις.
But such a use of δισσαῖς seems impossible.
Could δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα ( e. g. ) mean, ‘a chariot belonging to two <PERS>brothers</PERS> ’?
