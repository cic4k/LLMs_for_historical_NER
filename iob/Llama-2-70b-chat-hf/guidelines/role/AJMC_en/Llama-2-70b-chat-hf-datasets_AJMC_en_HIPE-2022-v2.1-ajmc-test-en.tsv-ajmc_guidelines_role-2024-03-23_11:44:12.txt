In all the cases given above , except one or two which are specified , <PERS>O</PERS> has preserved the correct reading , and almost invariably sides with <PERS>L</PERS> against <PERS>A</PERS> .
A few of O ' s minor corrections of A are omitted ; 6 , δ . in accent as 495 . τῶνδέ τοι : 628 , μεθεῖσά μοι , where A omits the acute accent : 779 . δε O . δεῖν᾽ A : 890 . μώραν O . μωρὰν Α : 1433 . Bare O . Bite A : 149% . πᾶσ᾽ O . πάσ ' A .
These illustrate the minute accuracy of <PERS>O</PERS> .
3 - From this list of readings it is plain that O is a more correct MS . than A , and a fairer representative of the family of MSS . to which A belongs .
The list of differences just given, in almost all of which O corrects A's errors, clearly shows A's tendency to interpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to A's family, but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of O's original.
The many places where the text of A omits a word or is corrupt , but where O supplies the omission and confirms L and the correct text , show that O certainly represents the text of an earlier date than A , when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which A has gathered .
4 . Certain corruptions are common to both O and A , and must have crept into the text of this family of the MSS . at a date considerably anterior to that of A .
The following is a list of all the errors common to O and A , which can be properly called errors of A ’ s family® .
A very few minor divergencies of accent and orthography are omitted .

These words develop the suggestion conveyed in φρενόθεν γε , to which they are attached with γάρ . <PERS>Ajax</PERS> cannot have done this ; at least not of his own impulse .
It may le , indeed , that a divine visitation is upon him .
This possibility is a farther reason for rejecting the notion that <PERS>Ajax</PERS> is really guilty .

The Chorus are uncertain of Ajax ' whereabouts, as Odysseus was , supr . 33 . μακραίωνι implies that some time had passed since the judgment of the arms and Ajax ' sullen withdrawal from the fight : cp . infr . 929 foll ἀγωνίῳ is a difficult word .
The inactivity of <PERS>Ajax</PERS> was his manner of contending with the chiefs : if the rumour was true , it was an inactivity in which he had been fatally active ; and however his leisure was employed, it was becoming full of danger to him ,
The force of ἀγών , in the sense of a dangerous contest , is therefore suited to the place , and the expression is an oxymoron , ‘ a perilous quarrelsome rest ’ ( for which , cp . <PERS>Shak</PERS> . <WORK>Ant</WORK> . and <PERS>Cleo</PERS> . 1 . 3 , < ’ Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart . )

The elision of the last syllable of <WORK>ὁρμᾶται</WORK> and the hiatus after <WORK>ἀτάρβητα</WORK> and <WORK>βαρυάλγητα</WORK> are doubtful points .
It can hardly be questioned that the a of εὐανέμοις ( for εὐηνέμοιΞ ) is long .
καχαζόντων is rightly restored for xayχα(ζόντων. <PERS>Brambach</PERS> , ( <WORK>Sophokl . Gesinge</WORK> ) suggesting εὐᾶνέμοις , gives the following scheme —

Musgrave suggested an allusion to the act of disguising himself as a wandering beggar mentioned in <WORK>Od . 4 . 242 foll .</WORK> , but preferred to derive ἄλημα ( = mawrdAn ) from ἀλέω .
The earlier explanation is here preferable to both these , and in infr . 390 , ἄλημα may quite well mean , ‘cause of error ’ ( <WORK>τῶν Ἑλλήνων</WORK> , gl . <PERS>Pall</PERS> ) .

But the asyndeton 15 rather impressive , and τῷ θεῷ may be explained ‘ the god who gives the laughter or the tears ’
'Laughter and sorrow are in the hands of God ; ' i . e . we must be patient and the position may be reversed. The chorus reflect that the Divine power which now favours <PERS>Odysseus</PERS> and oppresses <PERS>Ajax</PERS> may hereafter work the opposite effect .
Cp . Trach . 131 foll . ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ πῆμα καὶ χαρὰ | πᾶσι κυκλοῦσιν , οἷον | ἄρκτον στροφάδες κέλευθοι .
384 . The syllable which has been probably lost from this line has been variously restored , μέν , νῦν , μήν , etc . having been supplied .
The Triclinian reading is harmless , and is followed in the text , in the absence of better <PERS>MS</PERS> . authority .
Ajax prays to see his enemy , that , even ruined as he is , he may avenge himself .

28 τρανές , ‘clear , ’ like the cognate τορόν ( <WORK>rt . τερ , τρα , τε - τραίνω</WORK> , to pierce ) .
The adj . τρανής is not elsewhere extant . but τρανῶς is used by <PERS>Aesch</PERS> . ( <WORK>Ag</WORK> . 1371 ) and <PERS>Eur</PERS> . ( <WORK>El</WORK> . 758 ) .
The form τρανός was current in later Greek ; the earliest instance seems to be <PERS>Dionys</PERS> . <WORK>Halic</WORK> . ( <SCOPE>c . 25 B . C .</SCOPE> )
De Comp . Verborum c . 22 τρανὴν καὶ καθαρὰν δύναμιν . ἀλώμεθα : this fig . sense , with ref . to uncertainty ‘to be at sea , ’ as we say ) , belongs nowhere else to this verb , but often to πλανᾶσθαι ( <WORK>Her . 6 . 37</WORK> , etc . ; <WORK>Plat . Hipp . Ma . 304 C</WORK> πλανὦμοι μὲν καὶ ἀπορῷ ἀεί ) .
24 θελοντής . The form ἐθελοντής occurs in <WORK>Herodotus</WORK> , <WORK>Thucydides</WORK> , <WORK>Xenophon</WORK> , and the <WORK>Orators</WORK> , as ἐθελοντήρ does in <WORK>Od</WORK> . 2 . 292 .
On the other hand θελοντής is cited only from <PERS>Porphyrius</PERS> ( c . 270 A . D . , see <WORK>Lobeck</WORK>, <WORK>Phrym</WORK>. 7 ) and <PERS>Hierocles</PERS> ( c . 450 A . D . ) , ἄρ . <WORK>Slob</WORK>. For . 75 . 14 ( p . 449 . 20 ) .
Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by <PERS>Plato</PERS> ( <WORK>Crat</WORK>. 406 A ) , while the earliest authority for θελήμων is <PERS>Apoll</PERS>. <WORK>Rhod</WORK>. 2 . 557 .
In ragio iambics θέλω was naturally preferred , on metrical grounds , to ἐθέλω , though the latter occurs n tragic anapaests ( as <WORK>O . T . 1303</WORK> , <WORK>Ph . 145</WORK> ) .
If θελοντής were found in a passage where metre required it, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection.
But where , as here , aphaeresis was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote ἐθελοντής . — ὑπεῖύγην , as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself : cp . <WORK>P . 1025</WORK> κλοπῇ τε κἀνάγκη ξυγείς ( n . )
Aesch . P . P . 108 ἀνάγκαις ταῖσδ ’ ὑπέζευγμαι .

From the cognate form κατεναίρομαι we have κατήναρὲς in <WORK>Anmi</WORK>. 871 . - ἐς χερὸς , by a human hand .
The military sense , ‘at close quarters ’ ( <WORK>Ten . H . 7 . 2 . 14</WORK> ἐνέβαλὸν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἐμάχοντο ) , is less fitting here .
- αὐτοῖς ποιμνίον ἐπιστάταις ; cp . <WORK>fr . 873</WORK> αὐτοῖσιν ὅπλοις .
The idiom occurs in the <WORK>Iliad</WORK> ( as <SCOPE>8 . 24</SCOPE> ) , — sometimes with συν added ( as <SCOPE>14 . 498</SCOPE> ) , a form of it found also , though not often , in later poetry ( <WORK>Eur . Ion</WORK> 32 αὐτ ’ ξὺν ἄγγει ) . — ἐπιστάταῖς, ‘overseers , ’ masters ’ or ‘guardians ’ of them ; as a warrior is ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης ( <WORK>Aesch . Prs .</WORK> 379 ) , and a rower , ἐρετμῶν ( <WORK>Eur . Helen .</WORK> 1267 ) .

The answer is more forcible than if the poet had written κἂν ἐξέπραξέ T : see on <WORK>Ph</WORK>. 105 , 985 , <WORK>El</WORK>. 408 . - The midd. ἐκπράσσομαι is rare ; in <WORK>Her</WORK>. 7 . 158 it means to avenge ’ ( φόνον ) . Cp . <WORK>Q</WORK>. T . 287 ἐπραξάμην ( n . ) .

‘What were these daring schemes , what was this <PERS>ras</PERS> confidence , with which he planned the attack ? ’
- i . e . , How could he possibly have conceived such a mad enterprise ? ’
For ταῖσδε combined with ποίαισι , cp . <WORK>Ph . 1204</WORK> ποῖον ἐρεῖς τόδ ’ ἔπος ;
47 νύκτρ κ . τ . λ . : an answer to the last question : - he relied on darkness , and on craft ; and none shared his secret .

( <WORK>Cp</WORK> . <WORK>Pans</WORK> . 4 . 19 . 2 τὴν σκηνὴν τὴν στρατηγίδα . )
The phrase is equivalent , of course , to δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαις .
721 στρατήγιον , n .
But , since there were two tents and two entrances , δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις : i . e . , the literal sense is , ‘two doors of chiefs . ”
If the two chiefs had shared the same tent , so that only one entrance could be meant by πύλαις , then , indeed , δισσαῖς could be explained only as referring to the substance implied in στρατηγίσιν, “the tent-door of two chiefs, ’ = δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις .
But such a use of δισσαῖς seems impossible .
Could δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἄρματα (e.g.) mean, ‘a chariot belonging to two brothers’?

The fut . act . dρεῶ has better Ms . authority here ; but is ( <PERS>I</PERS> am now convinced) wrong .
It could mean only , ‘raise thy cowardice , ’ in the sense , ‘allow thy coward fears to rise , ’ — - a very forced one .
Further , there is no other example of a fut . act . ἀρῶ with ἄ . See note in Appendix on the Future and Aorist forms from ἀείρω , αἴρω , ἄρνυμαι .

‘Yes , ’ he answers , ‘my foeman , - as he is still . ’
