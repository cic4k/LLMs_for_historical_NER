FROM A <loc>VIRGINIA PAPER</loc>.
To his <org>EXCELLENCY</org> the <org>GOVERNOR GINIA</org> .
NEW - YORK , <LOC>SEPT . 28</LOC> , 1780 .
SIR , <org>WE</org> have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to tranlinit effec ¬ tual Amendments to the <loc>Conftitution of the Uni ¬ ted Stares</loc> , and it is with grief that we now fend forward propolitions inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments , and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our <loc>country</loc> .
By perusing the Journal of the Senate, your Excellency will see, that we did, in vain, bring to view the Amendments proposed by our Convention, and approved by the Legislature.
We fltall tranfmit a com ¬ plete let of the Journals of both Houfes of Con - grefsto your addrefs , which with a letter accom panying them , we entreat your Excellency will have the gaodnefs to lay before the <loc>Honorable Legillature</loc> of the enfuing meeting .
We have the honor , of every ( entiment of rc - fpeCt , to be , Sir , your Excellency ’ s moft obedient , and very humble fervants , <pers>RICHARD HENRY LEE WILLIAM GRAYSON</pers> .
PRESIDENT <pers>SULL IVAN</pers> ’ s MESSAGE .
To the <pers>Hon</pers> .
Senate and House ^ / ' Represen ¬ tatives , [ 0 / New - Hampshire . ] Gentlemen , H HVING been informed , that doubts have a - rifen iu the minds of fome , whether my hav ¬ ing accepted the office of <loc>Diftricft Judge</loc> has not difqualified me from aefling as <pers>Prefident</pers> of the State , until a new election takes place , I confefs that 1 have never been able to difcover any in ¬ compatibility in the two offices .
But as fome have attempted to prove this by urging the words of a <loc>Conflitution</loc> framed for the <org>purpofe</org> of efta - blifhing over the people of New - Humpfhire a free , fovereign and independent government — 1 mull obferve , that this govennent has <time>nice</time> been changed by the voice of the people , who have agreed that their fafety depended on their relinquifhuig many of the powers retained by the people in that Conflitution , to a <org>General Government</org> eflabl ' fbed for the people of each and every State who fnould adopt it ; which to themwai to become the general law of the land .
The people of this <loc>State</loc> did , in the <adjective>moff folemn</adjective> manner , a <verb>dipt</verb> arid ratify that <noun>Conflitution</noun> ; and from that <noun>e-vent</noun> , this ceased to be a <adjective>free</adjective> , <adjective>sovereign</adjective> , and <adjective>independent</adjective> state ; and upon my being <verb>elcdled</verb> to the office of <noun>Prefident</noun> , I was only <verb>fworn</verb> to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as <noun>Prefident</noun> of a <adjective>free</adjective> and <noun>confederate</noun> State ; and I was at or near the <noun>fame</noun> time <verb>fworn</verb> to <verb>fupport</verb> the <noun>Confti union</noun> of the <noun>United States</noun> , by virtue of a <noun>law</noun> enacted by yourselves .
I was appointed under that <loc>Conflitution</loc> which the people of <loc>New-Hampffiire</loc> had adopted for themfelves , a Judge of the <org>Federal Court</org> .
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wish to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the people , and could not devise a way of resigning the trust committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it .
I well knew that the time for electing a new <pers>Prefident</pers> was near at hand , when the people might have an op ¬ portunity of declaring who fhould prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been en - trufted to my care , and the affairs of the State un ¬ folded to me , I could not , without an unpardona - ble breach of truft , negleifl to lay them before you .
I alfo confidered , that while I was living in the State , no other perfon could , by your own laws , adminilter the neceffary oaths to you , to qualify you to aeft as Legifiators , while the time for which I was chofen was not expired ; and as I knew that this would probably be the laft feflion of this Court , for the prefent year ; and I had no inclination to propofe myfelf as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have pre ¬ vented fome perfons from purfuing the methods they have adopted , for gratifying a fpirit which ought never to lodge itfelf in the branch of a Legifla - ture .
Gentlemen , You will fee the fituation I am in , and may eafily conceive of my feelings upon this fubjeeft , being brought forward , at every opportunity , to fa ’ - tiate that fpirit which has often , before this fejjion of the Court , difplayed itfelf before me , and ufed every effort againfl me .
The <pers>Prefident</pers> and <org>Senate</org> of the United States were , at the time of my appointment , well ac ¬ quainted with my having to finifh my year in prefiding over this State ; but no hint has ever been given tome of my acceptance of an office under the prefent general government , rendering void any State appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often , fince my accep ¬ tance of the office of <org>Diftridl Judge</org> for New - Hampfttire , in company with the <pers>Prefident</pers> of the United States , who knew I was the <pers>Prefident</pers> of this State , and treated me as fuch , although he at the fame time knew that I had long before accept ¬ ed the office of <org>Federal Judge</org> .
I know the candour and juftice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightnefs to fuppofe , that they will fuffer themfelves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more , who cannot avoid at every opportunity , difeovering the fpirit which alhi - ates them in their conduB .
I have the honour , & c .

LONDON , <time>Dec . 31</time> .
The official account of the capture of <loc>Bruffels</loc> pnbliflied by the <org>Patriots</org> , is as under .
It is dated the 12<sup>th</sup> of December .
“ At length , notwithftanding the <loc>armifiice</loc> , and every other pretence , joo brave Patriots of <loc>Brufiels</loc> have dared to engage in battle with 6poo <pers>Aullrains</pers> .
The action commenced yesterday afternoon , at <time>four o’ clock</time> .
The first attenpt was to make prifoners of all the <pers>soldiers</pers> who guarded the <loc>Mint</loc>, and those who were quartered in the different <loc>converts</loc>.
General <pers>D’Alton</pers> did his turn off from fix o’ clock in the morning to negotiate an armistice .
About (even o’ clock, 8co men of <loc>Benden</loc> - <pers>D’Aloft</pers> entered the city with two pieces of cannon , which they planted on the <loc>Grand Place</loc> .
About ten o ’ clock, General <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> thought proper to send a large detachment in order to release, by forcible means, the officers and privates made prisoners in the <loc>Bafleville</loc>.
This was the <loc>fignal</loc> for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its <loc>victory</loc> .
The <org>Patriots</org> no longer able to contain themselves , routed the whole detachment .
To the number of joo , at the utmoft , they invelled the great market , and after a mod obllinatc conflict , they made them ¬ felves mafters of the <loc>Coros de Garde</loc> , and two pieces of cannon , and took obotlt 400 <org>Auftrians</org> prifoners .
About the fame time, the engagement re-commenced in all quarters of the city ; and , in less than two hours , the <org>Patriots</org> made themselves masters of the barracks of the military and of the magazines , in which they found near 2,000 muskets , besides cartridges , ammunition , & c .
To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the <loc>Park</loc> and the <loc>Palace Royale</loc> , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or cannon .
After a very heavy firing on both fides , <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> perceiving that the place was no longer tenable against so much bravery , capitulated for the immediate retreat of his whole garrison ; and the requell having been acceded to , about one o ’ clock they departed , with great precipitation , through the <loc>Porte de Namur</loc> .
But as all the <org>foldieis</org> arc not equally inclined to follow hinj , at the mo ¬ ment this is writing , they are fquabbling among theinlelves , without the <loc>city</loc> .
Already , we have got more than 3,000 <pers>prifoners</pers> ; but a few killed , and no <loc>houfes</loc> plundered .
For the <loc>Gazette of the United States</loc>, i Letter I . TO <pers>Thomas Jefferson</pers> , Vice President of the <org>Unit</org> .
!
States , <loc>Philad</loc> : <time>July 3</time> , <year>1800</year> .
AS you are a candidate for the <org>Supreme Magistracy</org> of the United States , a knowledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country .
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in political concerns , I would not have troubled you for the public with these setters , since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then , Sir , have glided down the current of Use in obscurity , and at least have had the consolation to know that your deformities were hidden from the world .
But , as , <pers>Sir</pers> , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the <org>Presidency</org> , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your country may perhaps confide her dearest interest to .
It is my duty , as it is my wiffi , to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess , and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered America in the course of a long life busied with public cares , — - But , Sir , it is also my duty to speak ot those other qualities of your <pers>heart and mind</pers> which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country .
Nature , Sir , in profusion , gifted you with talents , a brilliant fancy , penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction , combined with a thirst for knowledge , formed you a man of learning and taste , well acquainted with the <loc>classics</loc> , deeply read in the <org>philosophy of natural history</org> , observant of men and things , and attentive in theory to <org>political concerns</org> .
But , to balance tin fe singular favors , stie denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great <loc>nation</loc> , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable .
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your mind is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your closet you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of Nature ; but the fatigues , perseverance and firm Mnper , nectssiry in an Executive sta ¬ tion , would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened under ¬ standing useless to its possessor and injurious to his country .
Let me conjure you , <pers>Sir</pers> , to call to your remembrance the history of your political life , and from a regard to your peace and reputation , not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the <org>Presidency</org> .
You have been , Sir , a <org>Governor</org> , an <org>Ambassador</org> , and a <org>Secretary of State</org> , and had to desert each of these posts , from that weakness of nerves , want of fortitude and total imbecility of character , which have marked your whole political career , and most probably will attend you to your grave .
Remember, Sir, all the services you have rendered your country were of the literary kind—The Declaration of Independence was penned in your closet, where you were perfectly secure; but I do not recollect that you supported that Declaration by any extraordinary exertion, or by exposing yourself to any imminent danger.
When Governor <pers>os Virginia</pers> , you sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appoint ¬ ment by <org>Congress</org> .
A ; the danger was visi - ble , you acted consistently with your <chr>chr - racter</chr> , but surely did liot display either much <qual>firmness</qual> or <qual>patriotism</qual> .
But , Sir , weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are nayiral defects—they are not faults of your own—tho ’ were you , con ¬ scious of your desects , to accept the impor ¬ tant office of President , when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your country are depending , it would th my opinion , amount to a crime .
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the <org>htad</org> of a party devoted to the enemies of America , and a party created for her ruin .

The <loc>Cork papers</loc> of the 23rd of April state , that a spirit of insubordination begins to manifest itself in the vicinity of <loc>CharTevillc</loc> .
Nightly association are formed there , ami the peace and se ¬ curity of the neighborhood have been disturbed by turning up ground , noc ¬ turnal visits paid to the houses ul Wj * farmers , and threats of a very terrifr nature have been promulgated a ^ alD ^ some individuals who have lately taken land there .
TO THE <ORG>Cultivators of the Sul</ORG> THE <ORG>AMERICA</ORG> FARMER .
T <loc>HE</loc> first number of the <org>AMERICAN FARMER</org> , was issued on the <time>2d of April 1819</time> .
It may now be announced as an es tablisbed National work , adapted to all the varieties of our climate , since many oi the most eminent citizens in all the states , con tribute by their patronage and their pens , to its circulation and its usefulness To make known all discoveries in the <loc>science</loc> , and all improvements in the practice of <loc>Agriculture</loc> and <loc>Domestic Economy</loc>—and to develope the means and designate plans of internal improvements generally , consti tute the chief objects to which the <org>American Farmer</org> is devoted .
It takes no concern or interest in <org>party politics</org> , nor in <time>the transient occurrences of the day</time> .
The Farmer is published weekly , on <time>.</time>
- heel the size of a large newspaper , and folded o as to make eight pages—and to admit of being conveniently bound up and preserved in <prod>volumes</prod>.
Each volume will consist of fifty-two numbers, a title page, and an index; and numerous Engravings to represent new implements, and approved systems of husbandry. Each number gives a true and accurate statement of the th * m selling prices of country produce, live stock, and all the principal articles brought for sale in the <loc>Baltimore market</loc>.
.
Terms of subscription 4 dollars per an ¬ num , to be paid in advance .
But for the ' ' <prod>Urn of five dollars</prod> , the actual receipt of every number is guaranteed .

As the <org>Editor</org> takes the risk and cost of die mail—should subscription money miss, he holds himself, nevertheless, bound to furnish the <prod>paper</prod>.
To those who may think the price of subscription too high , it may be remarked , that on a comparison of their actual contents , one volume of the <org>American Farmer</org> , will be found to contain as much as four volumes of the <org>Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of Philadelphia</org> and the four volumes of that <org>patriotic</org> , and exceedingly valuable work , sell for <price>12 dollars</price> .
To shew that the American Farmer , is conducted in a manner to answer the great national purpose for which it was <org>stablish - ed</org> .
and that it is not on ieserving the encou ragementof the <org>Agriculturists of the Unit; d States</org> , the following testimonials are respect fully submitted—others equally conclusive , might be offered .
Extract of a letter from Governor Lloyd , » • ho is acknowledged to be one of the most wealthy , well informed and best managing <pers>farmers</pers> in the United States .
"The Farmer , so far , is the best Agricul tural compilation , in my humble opinion , that 1 have seen , and deserves the patron ¬ age of the public . ' ’ From the President of the Agricultural Soci ety , <loc>Eastern Shore of Maryland</loc> . 1 am anxious to preserve the whole of the work , and wish it was in the hands of every lamer in the <loc>United States</loc> . It is by the diffusion of knowle dge only , that we can expect our country to improve in Agricul ture , which thy paper is admirably calcula ted to impart , to all who will take pains to be improved by reading . ”

From a letter received in this place from a <pers>gentleman of intelligence</pers> , and from our exchange papers which come to us from different sections of the country , we have the utmost assurance in saying that the <loc>Indian</loc> cause is gaining ground .
There is a great excitement on this sub-ject and this excitement is extending .
Meetings have been held in <loc>New York</loc>, <loc>Philadelphia</loc>, <loc>New Haven</loc>, and <loc>Hartford</loc>, and memorials to Congress adopted—oth ¬ er meetings ill other places will be held .
From the abstract of the debate in the <loc>House of Representatives</loc> , on the question of referring the <loc>New York memorial</loc> to the <org>Committee on Indian Adairs</org> , which our readers will find in another part of our paper , there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of <org>Congress</org> ,
Washington , <time>January 25</time> , 1830 - Gentlemen .
Your letter of the <time>I8ih</time> has been re ¬ ceived .
We feel highly gratified to learn , that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable meeting in <loc>New - York</loc> , against the violation of ’ he trea ¬ ties with the <org>Cherokee</org> and other na ¬ tions of Indians , meets your approba ¬ tion .
In vindicating the sacred right of the <pers>citizen</pers> to petition government on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respectable meeting of our fellow citizens , on a subject involving the faith of the <loc>nation</loc> , its honor and character ; and the existence of a <pers>race of men</pers> .
now the remnant of a <loc>powerful nation</loc> ; we did no more than perform a <time>duty</time> ■ incumbent on us .

We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration , of what we said on the <loc>interesting occasion</loc> to which you re ¬ fer .

It is sup ¬ posed that the decent members will not at ¬ tempt business until the rowdies have ex ¬ hausted themselves—or the House been purged after a general knock down and drag out .
There has as yet been no bloodshed , except a little scratching and hair - pulling <loc>iu the lobby</loc> .
The Senate has done some busi ¬ ness , has passed the Sub - Treasury Bill , and seems inclined to be decent , though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock up the sand scene ’ good as you sir , ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir , ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — afiiiir between an old and young one , <pers>Messrs . Clay</pers> and <pers>Walker</pers> tother day - Why will <pers>Mr.</pers> <pers>31</pers> r .
Clay disturb the harmony of the Senate , and rutile ( lie even current of his unaspiring course by such discordant scrapes ?
From the <org>Otmndagiia</org> ( <loc>N . A .</loc> ) Standard .
The plan for disciplining the militia , proposed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , would cost only half a million of dollars annually ; while that proposed by <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> , with the present number of our militia , would cost about <amount>FOUR MIL ¬ LIONS OF DOLLARS</amount> annually .
Gen . <pers>Harrison</pers> proposed to place the whole force , brought under discipline on his system , distinctly within the control of <org>Ihe President</org> .
On the 3d of February last , <pers>Gen. Ilarrisou</pers> addressed a letter to the “ <org>Louisville Legion</org> , ” in which he mentioned the plan here brought to view as one of his principal efforts to improve the discipline of the <org>militia</org> .
And furthermore , <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> ’ s keepers have assured the public , that his sentiments have undergone “ no change . ”
Of course , then , <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official statiou , if placed in the Presidential chair , the odious and oppressively burthen - some scheme proposed by him iu a repot t to <org>Congress</org> .
Now , when the <org>Western State Journal</org> de ¬ nounces Gen. <pers>Harrison</pers> splan for organizing the militia , tho world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , and which has never received ihe approval of <pers>Mr . Yan</pers> !

From the <loc>Pennsylvanian</loc>.
Harrisburg , <time>June 26</time> , <year>1S40</year> .
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the <time>17th iust</time> .
, as well as another letter of similar import , dated <time>16th inst</time> .
, tender ¬ ing to me a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you , just on the eve of my depar ¬ ture from <loc>Philadelphia</loc> .
It is a matter of re ¬ gret to me , that time , and my other indispen ¬ sable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered <loc>hospitality</loc> Allow mo to return my warmest thanks for the “ high regard and esteem ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meri ¬ torious services .
” I cannot , and I ought not to suppose , that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have distinguished the history of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her government , every official act I may find it necessary to perform , and every recommendation I may feel called on to make , should meet with unanimous approval .
It would be as unreasonable as it would be vain to look for this .
Some of the questions that have agitated <loc>Pennsylvania</loc>, and required my action upon them , are among the most intricate and perplexed in the whole science of government , and have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion , in the minds of the wisest and best men in this , and other countries .
How , then , can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours , where habit , feeling , interest aud intelligence are so variously di ¬ versified and combined in their influence upon different <pers>individuals</pers> ?
At the time when the executive functions of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> passed into my hands , I found them beset with difficulties on all sides .
An overwhelming public debt—the interest <time>seini</time> - annually falling due upon it—a stupendous system of public improvements disjointed and unfinished—a banking system , involving an enormous amount of incorporated capital , directly or indirectly connected with the most of the business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details incontestable proofs of its unsoundness and imperfection—the banking institutions struggling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprise paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended , and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow , without knowing when it would fall , or on what portion with the greatest weight .
Such were some of the portentous embarrassments encountered at the outset of my official career , and the worst evils they portended have been fully realized .
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise , and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the <loc>people</loc> , according to my solemn convictions of out ) ' , and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost responsibility of my <loc>station</loc> .
1 assert no claim to infallibility or judgment , or to a share of wisdom superior to others , but to undeviating honesty of purpose I do avow that I have a title , of which no human power can deprive me .
Forming part of the Executive, he does, but a portion of the Legislative power of this commonwealth, he is often reduced to the unavoidable necessity, of sanctioning measures which do not in all respects meet his approbation, or to prevent, by refusing such sanction, any legislation on the subject at all.
Iu several Distances I have found myself in this dilemma , when my only choice was , between the two evils of an imperfect law , and no ' <org>egisla - tive</org> action whatever .
Iu such cases I have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none , and have generally yielded my assent , even though I had objections to some parts of the <loc>law</loc> .
7 ’ he lato resolutions providing for the time of resuming specie payments by the <org>batiks</org> was one of this description .
I thought at the time and still think that day fixed was too remote , but I believed the permanent interests of the community required that a day should be designated as speedily as possible for that event , and if it was not so grossly unreasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the time uncertain and indefinite , I should not prevent it becoming a law .
It was , moreover , a subject on which the <org>Legislature</org> had deliberated for months , and the ' fixing the precise day on which it should take place , being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle , a decent re ¬ spect for the opinions of the people ’ s repre ¬ sentatives , a majority of whom , in both bran ¬ ches , were elected by men of my own politi ¬ cal faith , seemed to forbid the propriety of in ¬ terposin ' * the negative power , with which the <org>constitution</org> had clothed the <pers>Executive</pers> .
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best , in whatever aspect it could be viewed .
According to the theory and practice of our government, legislation is a matter of compromise on most objects.
No one <org>co-ordinate department</org> has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar <prod>sentiments</prod>, on the part of the others .
All that either can do , is to take care that none of its essential prin ¬ ciples of constitutional construction , or public policy , shall be violated by the others ; when that is done , the remaining circle of duties cau be performed in a spirit of mutual conces - <org>sion and compromise</org> .
This is the doctrine of the <loc>constitution</loc>, the voice of the <pers>people</pers>, and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the <org>government</org> in harmony and goodwill .
7 ’ his principle affords the explanation of my approval of more measures than one , against portions of which I had objections ; and it is the only pretext on which the <org>Legislature</org> has refused or omitted to sanction recommendations of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this <loc>commonwealth</loc> .
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the <org>Legislature</org> on this subject , and it is for the <org>public</org> to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the <org>Legislature</org> , or that body right in refusing to adopt them .
I am gratified , however , in this , that <loc>iu</loc> most of the views embodied <loc>iu</loc> my recom ¬ mendations , the majority of the <org>House of Representatives</org> coincided with me in opinion , aud a number ofthe <org>Democratic</org> members of the <org>Senate</org> .
They failed , however , of success , and the remedy is in the hands of the people , if they approve of those measures , at the next <time>election</time> .
If they do not , whatever consequences follow , I have done my duty .
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this <loc>commonwealth</loc> , it will be found , I think , that though much has been left undone , « great deal has been accomplished .
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements , sustaining the faith and credit of the <org>state</org> , and terminating the present dis ¬ astrous suspension of specie payments , with provision which secures the public agaiust ar like recurrence in future , under a forfeiture of their charters by the <org>banks</org> ; and so far as de ¬ pends on me , will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced .
7 ' he improvement bill , it is univer ¬ sally admitted , coutains less objectionable matter than can be fouud in any prior legis ¬ lation on that subject .
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance ^ that the long practiced system of log - rolling , which has impoverished our <loc>treasury</loc> to the amount of some millions , is at au end .
7 he precise nature ofthe difficulties we have labored under , in achieving this much , can only be learned by those who examine with care and caudor into our <loc>real condition</loc> .
All the <org>pecuniary responsibilities</org> , as well as the <org>resources</org> of Pensylvania , must be taken into the account , in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued .
YY ’ e must take things as they are .
YY ' e cannot retrieve what was done by our predecessors ; and those who expect us fr > act as if <org>Pencj - lrnnia</org> had no public debt to provide for , uo unfinished improvements to complete , no public interests to be protected , betray an ignorance of our true situation that entitles either the censure or their praise to very little regard .
7 ' he favorable o - piuiun of those , who , like the gentlemen I ad ¬ dress , are familiar with the true interests ofthe <loc>citizens of Pennsylvania</loc> , is a gratifying en ¬ couragement to the <pers>public man</pers> .
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed , those who understand what the best interests of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them .
Even though those endeavors should not in all mi ¬ nute respects correspond with their own pe ¬ culiar sentiments .
Differing in mere matters of detail , I feel convinced that in all the great principles of public policy , the <org>democratic party</org> of Pennsylvania entertains but one fundamental system of opinion .
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good <org>government</org> .
Recent experience has confirmed this opinion , and assured me that time and experience are the great champions of the democratic cause .
I trust the recent and existing embarrassments of our situation and the means to obviate them , will clearly illustrate this truth .
I am certain that <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> surrounded as she has been by diffi ¬ culties on all hands , cau aud will be soon ex ¬ tricated , — that all evils complained of will be corrected , — abuses reformed , - — her contracts fulfilled , and every duty of government be faithfully performed , without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the <org>democratic party</org> of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> has ever held dear .
Please accept , gentlemen , for yourselves individually , the assurance of my high regard and consideration .

Dear Sir : The prominent attitude which you now occupy in relation to the coining Residential contest , confers upon every voter of this widely extended Republic , however humble may be his condition , a right to inquire your views upon each one of those momentous questions which now agitate the public mind .
Prompted , not by an impertinent curiosity , but solely by a desire to ascertaining , whether your views or those of <pers>General Harrison</pers> coincide more nearly with our own , we are induced to propound to you the following questions , viz
1. AY ill you , it re-elected President , veto any bill having for its object , the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia ; or would you sanction any bill granting appropriations o ! the public money , to any State , soliciting aid for the emancipation of iheir slaves ?
2 . Do you think that , at this time , the safety of the public money requires a re - charter - ing of the <org>United States Bank</org> ; or would you sign a bill chartering such an institution ?
3 . Are you in favor of preserving entire the <loc>Tariff Compromise</loc>
?
4. Would you sanction any bill granting appropriations of the public money, for the purposes of internal improvement, by means of canals, railroads, &c.?
I 5 . Do you approve of <pers>NIr Poinsett</pers> ’ s scheme for the organization of the militia ?
The preceding questions have been proposed to <pers>Nlr Harrison</pers> .
Ut - lieving their decision to be of vital importance to the interests and iu - titntions of the South , and hoping you ‘ Day conceive them to be of such consequence , as to rnci - t an answer , <pers>A A e</pers> are respectfully , Your obedient servants , <pers>JOHN I</pers> .

THE <LOC>HEW COUNTY BRIDGE</LOC> AND <LOC>SCHOOL</LOC>, <LOC>HOUSE</LOC>.
The new county bridge over the <loc>James river</loc>, just south of town, is completed and ready for public patronage .
Its entire length is 160 <loc>leet</loc> , and its substruction is built of 12x12 <prod>timbers</prod> , with a covering 16 <loc>leet</loc> wide , made of 7 inch <prod>plank</prod> , with a railing 3 <time>feet</time> high on each side .
The bridge was constructed by <pers>Peter Auberton</pers> of this city .
Mr . Auberton also took the <contract> contract for building the <loc>village school house</loc> for this place , which he expects to have done by the <time>first of February</time> .
The school building is 30x42 , 28 feet high above the stone foundation—which stands 2 feet above the ground . There is a partition , cutting off 12 feet from the front of the <loc>building</loc> , to be used for a stairway and entry room , leaving the school room on the first floor 30 feet square .
The front porch, which faces toward the <loc>south</loc>, is 8x12, and gracefully ornamented with different kinds of <prod>scroll work</prod> .
The <loc>cupola</loc> or <loc>belfry</loc> , is 8 feet square and very neatly finished .
The height from the top of the flag staff on the cupola to the ground is 62 feet high .
The structure is in every way first class , and cost about <prod>$3000</prod> .
'Mr. Auberton' has done a great deal of work for Stutsman county, having built the <loc>court house</loc> early in the fall, and we understand that his work has thus far given entire satisfaction.
A Bit oT Daring .
A Western paper tells the story of <pers>Steve Venard</pers> ’ s fight with three <org>robbers</org> in <time>1866</time> .
The stage coming to <loc>Nevada</loc>, <pers>Col</pers>.
, had been robbed by three <pers>men</pers> , and the <loc>treasure-box</loc> taken .
A party set out for its <loc>recovery</loc> .
Yenard , armed with a <prod>Henry rifle</prod> , followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rugged region .
The <loc>hills</loc> hung steep above .
The waters of the <loc>ravine</loc> came tumbling down its steep bed of <loc>bowl ¬ ders</loc> with a rush and a noise which rendered no other sounds audible .
Yenard attempted to cross the <loc>stream</loc> at the head of the <loc>fall</loc> .
He walked on a short <loc>log</loc> to a <loc>rock</loc> .
Above him rose the huge mass of <loc>granite</loc> , buttressed in front by two smaller <loc>rocks</loc> .
Between these latter was an alley which led to the base of the <loc>Titan</loc> .
His position was suen as to look up the <loc>alley</loc> .
At the base of the great rock Yenard discovered the leader of the gang sitting on the ground drawing his <weapon>revolver</weapon> .
Venard leveled his rifle upon the <pers>robber</pers> , <time>twenty feet</time> distant .
At the same time, he saw another <pers>gang member</pers> pointing at him over the edge of a rock .
There was no time to change his <time>aim</time> .
He fired ; the <pers>leader</pers> fell back , shot through the <loc>heart</loc> .
The other robber attempted to shield himself farther behind a rock , leaving the point of his <weapon>pistol</weapon> exposed over the top .
Venard covered the spot with his unerring <prod>Henry</prod> , and when the head of the robber peered over the top <pers>hi3 brain</pers> was pierced with a bullet .
There was yet another , but he was not to be seen .
His pistol might at that mo ¬ ment be pointing at <pers>Yenard</pers> .
The latter clambered up to beard him in his <loc>den</loc>.
He found the treasure , took the pistols from the <pers>dead</pers> , covered quickly the former with earth and leaves , and proceeded to hunt the missing <pers>robber</pers> .
He found him running up the <loc>mountain</loc> , sixty yards or more ahead .
Ve ¬ nard fired and the <pers>robber</pers> fell .
Another bullet , and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead .
TUB SCHOOL BOARD : Just what our school board propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear , but it ia safe to predict that no <pers>lady teacher</pers> will get the school .
The majority of the board are very much opposed to such an arrangement , and so long as they are <org>our people</org> have but little to fear from them in that direction .
W « believe that the board desire to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the <loc>people</loc> .
Mr . Lees , as well as Mr . McKechnie , stated to us not long since , that they would not in any degree favor the installation of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests of the <loc>people</loc> .
We do not oppose the hiring of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> because we are not particularly prejudiced against them , for we are not , and believe that some of the most reliable and able teachers that bless our land to - day are <pers>ladies</pers> .
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present , and we are of tbo opinion that we cannot , could a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , with no more than ordinary abili ¬ ty do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the county will agree with us when we answer most emphatically , no .
If our county was able to stand the extra expense, we would be in favor of hiring two teachers instead of one .
Could we see our way clear in this direction, we would then favor the engagement of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department, leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the <pers>capable gentleman teacher</pers> 's hands .
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against <pers>Mrs . Shoe ¬ maker</pers> , and in that account are opposed to her being engaged is basely false .
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately , in regard to <pers>Mrs . Shoemaker</pers> which would in any way convey the idea that vre are personally prejudiced against her .
We are not in favor of her teaching the school for the same reasons that we would oppose any other <pers>lady teacher</pers> who might be endeavoring to get it .
A little over a year ago, the <org>Sturgeon Lendcr</org> published a very sensational account of the marriage of <pers>Miss Nettie White</pers> to <pers>Robt</pers> .
L . <pers>Winn</pers> .
Miss White.at the time , was engaged to both <pers>Chas</pers> .
and <pers>Robt</pers> .
Winn , two brothers , but had much difficulty in deciding which of her <pers>lovers</pers> was the <pers>wbichest</pers> .
Robt .
, however , proved to be the successful suitor .
The young couple recently agreed to dis ¬ agree , and the faithless <pers>Robt</pers> .
left for <loc>Texas</loc>, and the young wife re ¬ turned to the home of her parents , and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant spouse upon the <loc>grounds</loc> of desertion .
The pros ¬ pects for a re - hearing for the dis ¬ consolate <pers>Charles</pers> , who has spent the intervening time in repining , are growing very bright , as the young lady now declares that she really loved <pers>Charles</pers> best in tbe first place .
The firm of <org>Geo</org> .
D. Barnard iSr Co. , of <loc>St. Louis</loc> , a firm which some officials in this county give a great many orders for letterheads, envelopes, and such other blanks as could be furnished by the printing offices in this county , are all <org>Republicans</org> , but <pers>Mr. Keene</pers> , their traveling salesman in this territory , we understand , is a <org>Democrat</org> .
We have been in ¬ formed , upon good authority , that <org>Messrs . Barnard & Co</org> are not uni ¬ form in their prices .
For instance , ’ a certain blank book they have beer * known to sell in <loc>Montgomery county</loc> for $17 .
In <loc>St . Charles county</loc> they place “ a tariff ” of <currency>SI '</currency> , on the same book , and in <loc>Lincoln county</loc> the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from ” <currency>$21</currency> for the very same book .
We presume their prices arc made in proportion to the number of <prod>pocket-knives</prod> , <prod>gold pens</prod> , etc . , they give away to capture an order .
If Democratic county officials will send their orders abroad for job work , let them , at least , patronize Democratic <org>firms</org> .
Curiosities of the <PROD>Postage Stamp</PROD> .
There are about 6,000 varieties of postage stamps now in use by the different <loc>nations</loc> of the world .
The museum of the Berlin post - cfllce alone contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens , half of which are European and the remaining ¬ der divided between tbe <loc>Americans</loc> , <loc>Asia</loc> , <loc>Africa</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc> .
The emblems upon the stamps of nations are legion ; the <loc>earth</loc>, the <loc>sea</loc> and the <loc>vaulted canopy above</loc> have been ransacked for curious and meaningless devices and legends .
The en ¬ tire animal kingdom , the stars and the moon in all its phases , besides legendary emblems by the thousand , are known to the <org>oollLctors of stamps</org> , who pride themselves upon being “ <pers>philatelists</pers> .”
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be found the portraits of five emperors, eighteen kings, three queens, one grand duke, several inferior titled rulers, and many presidents.
M. Pliillippe de Ferrari perhaps has the largest and most valuable collection of stamps in the world, amounting to something like 20,000, and within the present year, he sold one little stamp to a collector in Paris for 150,000.
In <loc>England</loc> and other parts of <loc>Europe</loc> , horseshoes are now in use , made of <material>cowhide</material> instead of <material>iron</material> .
The shoe is composed of three thicknesses of the <material>hide</material> which is pressed into a solid steel mould and afterward treated by a chemical process .
It is said to be far superior , in several particulars , to the <prod>iron shoe</prod> .
Agriculture on the <loc>Yukon</loc>.
Wheut .
Vr ( jet » bl « uml Sum 11 Fruit * Will Grow There .
Vice Consul <pers>Morrison</pers> of <loc>Dawson City</loc> , sends to <loc>Washington</loc> a report on the results of agricultural experiments , written by a <pers>resident</pers> of that day .
which reads in part , as follows : " Grain has done exceptionally well , being well filled , and I see no reason why It should not be extensively and successfully grown here .
As far as my obser ¬ vations go .
the climate here is as suitable for raising winter wheat as in any place in the <loc>northwestern</loc> or <loc>northern</loc> states of America .
From my ex ¬ perience of the last two years .
1 see no reason why this <loc>country</loc> should not be able to produce its <prod>own vegetables</prod> and <prod>grains</prod> .
As for flowers , the success I have had proves that all <loc>hardy annuals</loc> will do well .
The coming year I intend to plant several hundred hybrid roses, also summer flowering bulbs, a large variety of other hardy and half-hardy annuals, and some of the hardy perennials.
Small fruit , such as <loc>strawberries</loc> .
currants
blackberries and <loc>raspberries</loc> should do well .
Currants , raspberries , cranberries , strawberries and <loc>blueberries</loc> crow wild here .

The <org>Shirt Waist</org> .
Very inviting are the displays of <org>Oxfords</org> , <org>Cheviots</org> , <org>Zephyrs</org> and <org>Madras</org> cloths for the shirt waist , and the made - up models have already pushed out of place their winter representa ¬ tives in cloth , velvet and fine <org>llannels</org> .
We shall wear the comfortable <prod>wools</prod> , aye , and even buy them for some time to come , but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the thinner <prod>suc ¬ cessors</prod> .
A pretty feature in the wash waist for next summer is their <loc>simplicity</loc> .
The human form divine is to have a chance to breathe once more , for the voluminous starchy fronts arc no more .
Even those professing to be <loc>loose</loc> have no surplus material , and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain , fitted over shoulders and bust and buttoned simply down the <loc>back</loc> .
Red dotted swiss has the entire front crossed In diamonds <PROD>^</PROD> of white val insertion , the undarted front Just puck ¬ ered a little at the belt , the plain back closed with bullet - shaped pearl buttons .
The close sleeves have a tight cult , and the simple , unlined col ¬ lar has little oblong turnovers of <loc>Swiss</loc> and <loc>Valenciennes</loc> lace .
Another style for these <prod>buttou - up - the - back waists</prod> Is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting .
Ibis Is of the <prod>styte</prod> which is purchased ready tucked and joined , and saves infinite labor , besides being nicer than the most careful home <pers>seamstress</pers> could make it .
Madras waists , aiso so fastened , have a slender - rest of tucking , running down to a point at the <loc>waist</loc> , and have little re - vers from the <loc>neck</loc> f o the <loc>bust</loc> on each side .
These are also of tucking and simply finished with a frill of narrow <prod>lace</prod> .
Large collars and full , fussy re - vers are not shown at all .
There is every evidence that the <time>1900 summer girl</time> proposes , above all , to be sweetly cleanly .
Her <loc>waists</loc> say plainly enough that it will be a simple matter to wash and Iron them , and there need be no lack In their number for that reason .
One feature which marks them ns new and far prettier than the old shirt waists is the entire absence of <prod>yokes</prod> of any kind , even In the back .
The only semblance of a yoke is the one which is trimmed and applied to the shoulders , forming a little <loc>epaulet</loc> over the sleeves .
The backs of the semi ¬ full front waists are tucked and plaited to correspond with the <loc>front</loc>.
There are stiff linen cuffs , with rounded cor ¬ ners and detachable collars , which can be discarded altogether for the more becoming <prod>stocks</prod> , and long silk scarfs tied twice around the neck .

As soon as the committee was assembled , <pers>Senator Hanna</pers> was unanimously re-elected chairman for the next four years . In accepting the nomination , he made a very short speech , in which he thanked the old members of the committee who had stood by him in the campaign of 1895 . and said that in taking the position for another four years , and especially for the coming campaign , he did so with the direct understanding that every member of the <org>national committee</org> would stand by him and work loyally for the success of the ticket which had been nominated today .
Colonel <pers>Dick</pers> of Ohio was elected temporary secretary .
Chairman <pers>Ilanna</pers> i was authorized to select from the <org>meiu</org> - i l ' ers of the national committee an » * x ! ecutlvo campaign committee , and the <org>j committee</org> then adjourned subject to ‘ the call of the chairman .

 FOREIGN WORDS .
Soma General Rule * That Will Aid in Pro¬nouncing Them .
Many foreign words have become a part of the English language through frequent use and it is wise and proper to pronounce them according to the rules of English .
There are , on the other hand , <loc>ninny</loc> words that do not readily lend themselves to the <loc>English</loc> style of pronunciation , or that are not used often enough to warrant it .
In pronouncing such words, the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the foreign languages .
In Latin, two vowels are not put in one syllable unless they are joined as a diphthong.
There are as many syllables as there are vowels in a <loc>word</loc> .
( Si ' - ne di ' - e for sine die . » In German , the letter w has the sound of v in English . ( <pers>Vahg</pers> ' - ner for <pers>Wagner</pers> . )
Tlie same is true in French , though w is only found in words that have been borrowed from other <loc>lan ¬ guages</loc> .
The letter i in German and in the Latin tongues , viz : <lang>French</lang> , <lang>Italian</lang> and <lang>Spanish</lang> , lias tlie sound of long e .
( <loc>Peek</loc> for <pers>pique</pers> , Fr . : <loc>Bee</loc>' - <loc>an</loc> - <loc>ko</loc> for <pers>Bianco</pers> , It . ; <loc>I</loc> > <loc>ee</loc>' - <loc>os</loc> for <pers>Dios</pers> , Sp . )
In the Latin tongues , also , the letter <pers>a</pers> generally , though not always has the broad sound , while the letter <pers>o</pers> has the long sound .
The letter c in Italian : n when followed by e or i has the sound of eh .
( Viu ' - cliee for <org>Vinci</org> . )
Final consonants in French are nearly always silent .
( Pah for <loc>Pas</loc> . )
So also is final e silent unless , an accent mark is placed above it .
The <loc>aecentiMl</loc> e has the sound of long a in English or a sound quite close to that .
The syllables in French words are never accented as in English words .
All of them are supposed to receive equal emphasis , but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into the next word, as is often done .
The French make frequent use of nasal vowels , so - called , the correct pronunciation of which is difficult to acquire .
The nasal vowel is composed of a vowel and a consonant—<pers>m</pers> or <pers>n</pers> .
The consonant is practically silent , but serves to give the nasal tone to the <pers>vowel</pers> .
The pronunciation of the word salon , ( for example ) as given in <org>Webster's</org> dictionary .
Is <loc>sa</loc> - loug ' .
It should be observed that in the front of tlie dietionary it is explicitly stated that this ng is silent , being used only to convey the idea of tin * nasal sound .

Why does <loc>Great Britain</loc> buy its oatmeal from <loc>us</loc> ?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to speak of exporting oatmeal to Scotland and yet , every year the <org>Quaker Oats Company</org> sends hundreds of thousands of cases of <prod>Quaker Oats</prod> to Great Britian and Europe , The reason is simple ; while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically , and active mentally of all people , the American has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade .
How well he has succeeded would be seen at a glance at the export re ¬ ports on <org>Quaker Oats</org> .
This brand is recognized as without a rival in clean ¬ liness and delicious flavor .

CRIMSON CLOVER <org>I</org> had a short article in last week ’ s <org>Herald</org> on the importance of crimson clover , and <org>I</org> have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil .
Now
I am not acquainted with all the <pers>farmers</pers> who have grown crimson clover in <loc>Putnam county</loc> and 1 wish I was .
I would have a great many more short articles published , but to any one who has grown this crop and feels like recommending it to his farmer friends please write a short piece and send to me or the <org>Herald</org> with your name signed , so we can see who has had the experience .
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of crimson clover : First , prepare - the <loc>seed bed</loc> well .
Make the seed / bed as for <crop>wheat</crop> or <crop>clover</crop> and sow 15 to 20 lbs .
of se6d to the acre and if there has be n other clover grown on the land recently, inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise, <org>Inoculation</org> should be applied .
.
Either get some soil from <loc>clover field</loc> or get the liquid inoculation and inoculate the seed before sowing , but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the <time>bright sunlight</time> .
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in <loc>’ the shade</loc> to dry and then sow in the early morning or in the evening or on <time>.</time>
a cloudy day with the <prod>harrow</prod> following the <prod>seeding</prod> .
In this way the inoculation is effective .
Apply when seeding crimson clover some 15 per cent acid phosphate from 100 to 300 pounds to the acre .
Tn this way the <loc>clover</loc> gets a good growth and the better the <loc>clover</loc> grows the more <subst>nitrogen</subst> it gathers and stores in .
the <loc>soil</loc> , consequently the better <prod>crop</prod> you get following the <prod>crimson clover</prod> .
* If you are sowing for a pasture and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of <prod>rye</prod> with the <prod>crimson clover</prod> .
It will furnish more pasture and help to hold the <loc>clover</loc> .
Hoping to see your testimony of growing crimson clover in the paper next week , if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow , let us hear from you .

CLEARING UP THE EDENTON CENSUS COUNT Edentonians have been raising quite a squawk over the census returns , They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their duties , that the carriers beak ; cf the Edenton post office shows that the post office serves approximately 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they are claiming for a new enumeration .
In the <loc>efTia</loc> of the <pers>District Supervisor of Census</pers>, this is cla .
s - id as <org>Chamber of Commerce</org> and press <org>ballyhoo</org> .
Edentonians have been boasting ‘ for several years that the population of their town was more than 5,000, but the official count revealed only 3,519. Edentonians were disappointed and began to grumble. Several sly busybodies, anxious to boost the population of their town, borrowed the carrier’s books from the post office and counted all the names therein. They found nearly 4,500 names in the books. And immediately, a cry was raised. ‘We want a new tabulation. There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us. "
Bui it was just so much hokum , in the opinion of a representative of the <org>District Supervisor's office</org> . If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edcnton ' s population is ever the 4.000 mark , they didn ' t succeed in fooling anyone else . When a person or a family moves to a town , the name is placed in the <loc>carrier's book</loc> . But . when they leave town , their names are not struck off the book ! ; . Go everyone who moved to Edcnton from 1920 to 1930 was included in the <loc>post office carriers' list</loc> , and the names of everyone who moved from Edenton in that ■ ■ period of time were not removed from the books . Edentonians even wanted to include in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians working away from Edenton , but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by <pers>Uncle Sam</pers> . So the official census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519 . Eden - tonians’ protests to the county notwithstanding .

Florida Court Sidesteps <loc>THE FLORIDA SUPREME Court</loc> has declined to order admission of five <pers>Negroci</pers> to the state - supported <loc>University of Florida</loc> .
By unanimous vote , the court upheld a plan of the state board of control to enroll all race students at the Florida A. & M. College for Negroes, and give those desiring courses not offered at the Negro school temporary instruction at the white institutions, <loc>Ut</loc> . The opinion stated that the plan to provide temporary instruction at the white institutions until “adequate and comparative facilities are offered at the Negro institution” meets all requirements of the federal law . The ruling further states that the temporary arrangement “conforms as nearly as it can with due regard to the paramount federal law, with the long established policy of the state of Florida that there shall be a system of segregation of the races in the state school system, but that impartial provisions shall be made for the schools for white and Negro schools alike .”
There is no greater farce than the diabolically “ sep ¬ arate . but equal ” system in educational institutions and public carriers of which the Southland adheres to so tenaciously . Several of the southern states , notably . <loc>Texas</loc> , <loc>Arkansas</loc> , and <loc>Oklahoma</loc> , have let down their bars of segregation , and have agreed to abide by the Supreme Court ruling of admitting Negroes into the white s f nte - supported institutions . IT SEEMS that the learned judges of the <loc>Florida</loc> Supreme Court have “ strained at a mountain and pro ¬ duced a knat ” Certainly , the action of there Florida scions does not represent the New South , but rather the echoes of ante bellum days . <loc>Florida</loc> , the land of sunshine , oranges and kumquot ? is out of step with other progressive southern states . The lawmakers of that state should drink from their own Fountain of Youth , and thus become invigorated re - born and revivea’ from their apparent stupidity , and like men - wise and judicious - mete out justice to all men alike .
THIS ‘ ♦ TEMPORARY * educational setup decreed by the unanimous decision of the <loc>Florida Supreme Court</loc> is an unfair judicial enactment . While it may serve a « an appeasement to some of the southern die hards , it cannot stand . Like the Morning Glory vine , it may flourish for a season , but i f s da vs are numbered And these <loc>Florida solons</loc> think they have by - passed the <loc>VS</loc> .

under the theme , “ Girded for Progress a <time>Mid-Century</time> .”
The opening meeting was called to order by <pers>Mrs . Chris ¬ tina Fuqua</pers> , president of <loc>De ¬ troit</loc> .
Mich . , and opened with a solo by <pers>Mrs . Mattie S . Bibb</pers> .
Mrs . <pers>E</pers> . <pers>R</pers> . <pers>Naggles</pers> .
Iota Phi Lambda sorority , <loc>Tuskegee Institute</loc> , welcomed the <org>League</org> to Tuskegee .
followed by a solo by <pers>Mrs . Willie M . Miller</pers> with <pers>Mrs . A . R Ashley</pers> as accompanist .
In addressing the League , <pers>Mrs . Fuqua</pers> explained the purpose of the League , its achievements and how it can function in a com ¬ munity .
knowing its national pos¬ sibilities .
The president pointed out that women should be proud that they spend the “ must ' * dollars ; that is . the dollar for the home and that they could help by being a part of the growing Negro busi ¬ nesses . She stated that pool - buying would help Negro busi ¬ nesses to expand . <pers>Horace Sudduth</pers> , president of the National Negro Business League stated in his address to the Business and Housewives League ; ‘ There is nothing that will build our neighborhood business ¬ es on a competitive basis faster than the program that has been carried on by the Housewives League for the past 17 years . The effectiveness of this program has been proved wherever Housewiv ¬ es Leagues exist . We must have trong , functioning Housewives Leagues working side by side with every affiliated local league . We must carry them right along with us . As we grow strong , they will grow * strong . ”
Mrs . <pers>Fuqua</pers> urged all members and visitors of the fifteen states represented at the Convention who were engaged in new <prod>enterprises</prod> of manufacturing , to join the league or keep in touch with it in order that they may be <prod>promoted</prod> .
Among the guests were : <pers>Mrs . H . F . Thomas</pers> .
Birming ¬ ham , Ala . , a <org>rug and mattress manufacturer</org> ; and <pers>Mrs . Freddvo S Henderson</pers> .
Atlanta , <loc>Ga</loc> .
a <prod>fashion designer</prod> .
In stressing the theme of the convention , emphasis was put on pool buying to help our people buy gross instead of dozens : <loc>barrels</loc> instead of <loc>gallons</loc> , <loc>bolts</loc> instead of <loc>yards</loc> ; <loc>carloads</loc> instead of <loc>cases</loc> .
This will in turn build better <loc>stores</loc> where there are <loc>shops</loc> ; <loc>garages</loc> where there are <loc>filling stations</loc> , <loc>storage houses</loc> where there are <loc>storerooms</loc> ; more <pers>employees</pers> where there are <pers>employers</pers> , <loc>communities</loc> where there are <loc>slum homes</loc> , churches as they should be ; schools where they are <time>needed</time> .
Egg Producers Asked To Vole The <loc>Columbus County</loc> com ¬ mittee which will supervise the <pers>Hetiny Benny</pers> referendum on <time>Apt il 2</time> is making final plans .
“ We want to be sure that every egg producer in the county votes , whether for or against the <loc>peiiny - a - hcn</loc> as ¬ sessment , ” said <pers>Marvin Lewis</pers> , chairman of the committee .
| “ That includes producers of <prod>hatching eggs</prod> , too . "
Money raised through the assessment will be used by a North Carolina Kgg Association, which will be organized if the referendum passes. It’s estimated that about $30,000 will be available to finance the association. One cent will be collected by poultry processors on each hen processed in the state. The Association will use the money to hire an executive and to pay for advertising and promotion of Tar Heel eggs. "Tar Heel eggs brought about $70 million in income last year," said Chairman Lewis.
“ Ye - North Carolina producers contributed only about $1.1 ) 00 towards the $300,000 given na - I tionally by producers for ad - | vertising anil promotion of egg salts throughout the nation . ’ <pers>ic chairman</pers> said that " pro ¬ motion and consumer educa ¬ tion are highly essential to sales tif North Carolina eggs both within and without the state . North Carolina is only few hundred miles , over ¬ night by truck , from the high ¬ consuming tenters of popula ¬ tion mi tlie North Atlantic coast . ”
