To his <pers>EXCELLENCY</pers> the <org>GOVERNOR GINIA</org> .
NEW - YORK , <time>SEPT . 28</time> , <year>1780</year> .
SIR , <org>WE</org> have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to tranlinit effec ¬ tual Amendments to the Conftitution of the <loc>Uni ¬ ted Stares</loc> , and it is with grief that we now fend forward propolitions inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments , and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our <loc>country</loc> .
By perufing the <humanprod>Journal of the Senate</humanprod> , your Excellency will fee , that we did , in vain , bring to view the <humanprod>Amend ¬ ments</humanprod> propofed by our <humanprod>Convention</humanprod> , and approv ¬ ed by the <org>Legiflature</org> .
We fltall tranfmit a com ¬ plete let of the Journals of both Houfes of Con - grefsto your addrefs , which with a letter accom panying them , we entreat your <pers>Excellency</pers> will have the gaodnefs to lay before the <org>Honorable Legillature</org> of the enfuing meeting .
We have the honor , of every ( entiment of rc - fpeCt , to be , Sir , your Excellency ’ s moft obedient , and very humble fervants , <pers>RICHARD HENRY LEE WILLIAM GRAYSON</pers> .
PRESIDENT <pers>SULL IVAN</pers> ’ s MESSAGE .
To the <pers>Hon</pers> .
Senate and House ^ / ' Represen ¬ tatives , [ 0 / New - Hampshire . ] Gentlemen , H HVING been informed , that doubts have a - rifen iu the minds of fome , whether my hav ¬ ing accepted the office of <org>Diftricft Judge</org> has not difqualified me from aefling as <pers>Prefident of the State</pers> , until a new election takes place , I confefs that 1 have never been able to difcover any in ¬ compatibility in the two offices .
But as fome have attempted to prove this by urging the words of a <org>Conflitution</org> framed for the <org>purpofe</org> of efta - blifhing over the people of New - Humpfhire a free , fovereign and independent government — 1 mull obferve , that this govennent has [ nice been changed by the voice of the people , who have agreed that their fafety depended on their relinquifhuig many of the powers retained by the people in that Conflitution , to a General Government eflabl ' fbed for the people of each and every State who fnould adopt it ; which to themwai to become the general law of the land .
The people of this <loc>State</loc> did , in the moff folemn manner , a dipt arid ratify that <humanprod>Conflitution</humanprod> ; and from that e - vent , this ceased to be a free , sovereign , andindependent state ; and upon my being elcdled to the office of <pers>Prefident</pers> , I was only fworn to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as <pers>Prefident</pers> of a free and confederate State ; and I was at or near the fame time fworn to fupport the <org>Confti union of the United States</org> , by virtue ofalaw enacted by yourfelves .
I was appointed under that <loc>Conflitution</loc> which the people of <loc>New - Hampffiire</loc> had adopted for themfelves , a Judge of the <org>Federal Court</org> .
My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the <pers>people</pers> , and could not devife a way of re - figning the <org>truft</org> committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it .
I well knew that the time for electing a new Prefident was near at hand , when the people might have an op ¬ portunity of declaring who fhould prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been en - trufted to my care , and the affairs of the State un ¬ folded to me , I could not , without an unpardona - ble breach of truft , negleifl to lay them before you .
I alfo confidered , that while I was living in the State , no other perfon could , by your own laws , adminilter the neceffary oaths to you , to qualify you to aeft as Legifiators , while the time for which I was chofen was not expired ; and as I knew that this would probably be the laft feflion of this Court , for the prefent year ; and I had no inclination to propofe myfelf as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have pre ¬ vented fome perfons from purfuing the methods they have adopted , for gratifying a fpirit which ought never to lodge itfelf in the branch of a Legifla - ture .
Gentlemen , You will fee the fituation I am in , and may eafily conceive of my feelings upon this fubjeeft , being brought forward , at every opportunity , to fa ’ - tiate that fpirit which has often , before this fejjion of the Court , difplayed itfelf before me , and ufed every effort againfl me .
The Prefident and Senate of the United States were , at the time of my appointment , well ac ¬ quainted with my having to finifh my year in prefiding over this State ; but no hint has ever been given tome of my acceptance of an office under the prefent general government , rendering void any State appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often , fince my accep ¬ tance of the office of Diftridl Judge for New - Hampfttire , in company with the Prefident of the United States , who knew I was the Prefident of this State , and treated me as fuch , although he at the fame time knew that I had long before accept ¬ ed the office of Federal Judge .
I know the candour and juftice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightnefs to fuppofe , that they will fuffer themfelves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more , who cannot avoid at every opportunity , difeovering the fpirit which alhi - ates them in their conduB .
I have the honour , & c .

LONDON , <time>Dec . 31</time> .
The official account of the capture of <loc>Bruffels</loc> pnbliflied by the <org>Patriots</org> , is as under .
It is dated the <time>12th of December</time> .
“ At length , notwithftanding the <time>armifiice</time> , and every other pretence , joo brave <pers>Patriots of Brufiels</pers> have dared to engage in battle with <pers>6poo Aullrains</pers> .
The action commenced yesterday afternoon , at <time>four o’ clock</time> .
The firft attenpt was to make prifoners of all the <pers>loldiers</pers> who guarded the <loc>Mint</loc>, and thofe who were quartered in the different <loc>converts</loc> .
General <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> did his tu ¬ rnoff from fix o ’ clock in the morning to negociate an armifiice .
About (even o’ clock, 8co men of <loc>Benden</loc> - <pers>D’Aloft</pers> entered the city with two pieces of cannon , which they planted on the <loc>Grand Place</loc> .
About ten o ’ clock <pers>General D ’ Alton</pers> thought proper to fend a large dctatchment in order to releafe , by forcible means , the <pers>ollicers</pers> and <pers>privates</pers> made prifoners in lhe <loc>Bafleville</loc> .
This was the fignal for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its <humanprod>victory</humanprod> .
The <org>Patriots</org> no longer able to contain themselves , routed the whole detachment .
To the number of <loc>joo</loc>, at the <loc>utmoft</loc>, they invelled the great market , and after a mod <org>obllinatc</org> conflict , they made them ¬ felves mafters of the <org>Coros de Garde</org> , and two pieces of cannon , and took <loc>400</loc> <org>Auftrians</org> prifoners .
About the fame time the engagement re - commenced in all quartersof the city ; and , in lefs than two hours , the <org>Patriots</org> made themfelves matter of the barracks of the <org>military</org> andofthe <org>magazines</org> , in which they found near 2,000 muf - kets , befides cartridges , ammunition , & c .
To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the <loc>Park</loc> and the <loc>Palace Royale</loc> , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or cannon .
After a very heavy firing on both fides , <pers>D ’ Alton</pers> perceiving that the place was no longer tenable against so much bravery , capitulated for the immediate retreat of his whole garrison ; and the requell having been acceded to , about one o ’ clock they departed , with great precipitation , through the <loc>Porte de Namur</loc> .
But as all the <org>foldieis</org> arc not equally inclined to follow hinj , at the mo ¬ ment this is writing , they are fquabbling among theinlelves , without the <loc>city</loc> .
Already , we have got more than 3,000 <pers>prifoners</pers> ; but a few killed , and no <loc>houfes</loc> plundered .
For the <org>Gazstte of the Unites States</org> , i Letter I . TO <pers>THOMAS JEFFERSON</pers> , <org>Vice President of the Unit</org> .
!
States , <loc>Philad</loc> : <time>July 3</time> , <time>1800</time> .
AS you are a candidate for the <org>Supreme Magistracy</org> of the <loc>United States</loc> , a knowledge ¬ ledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country .
— Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in politi ¬ cal concerns , I would not have troubled you cr the public with these setters , since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then , Sir , have Aided down the current of Use in obscurity , and at least have had the consolation to know that your de ¬ formities were hidden from the world .
But , as , <pers>Sir</pers> , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the <org>Presidency</org> , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your country may perhaps confide her dearest interest to .
It is my duty , as it is my wiffi , to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess , and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered <loc>America</loc> in the course of a long life busied with public cares , — - But , Sir , it is also my duty to speak ot those other qualities of your ' heart and mind which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country .
Nature , Sir , in profusion , gifted you with talents , a brilliant fancy , penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction , combined with a thirst for knowledge , formed yqp a man of lea rung and taste , well acquainted with the <humanprod>classics</humanprod> , deeply read in the <humanprod>philosophy of natural history</humanprod> , observant of men and things , and attentive in theory to <humanprod>political concerns</humanprod> .
But , to balance tin fe singular favors , stie denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great <org>nation</org> , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable .
— Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your mind is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your closet you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of <loc>Nature</loc> ; but the fatigues , perseverance and firm <pers>Mnper</pers>, nectssiry in an Executive sta ¬ tion , would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened under ¬ standing useless to its possessor and injurious to his country .
Let me conjure you , <pers>Sir</pers> , to call to your remembrance the history of your political life , and from a regard to your peace and reputation , not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the <org>Presidency</org> .
You have been , <pers>Sir</pers> , a <org>Governor</org> , an <org>Ambassador</org> , and a <org>Secretary of State</org> , and had to desert each of these posts , from that weakness of nerves , want of fortitude and total imbecility of character , which have marked your whole political career , and most probably will attend you to your grave .
Remember , Sir , , all the services youevei rendered your coun ¬ try were of the literary kind—The Declara ¬ tion of Independence was penned in , your closet , where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that Declaration by any extraordinary exer ¬ tion , or by exposing yourself to any immi ¬ nent danger .
When <pers>Governor - os Virginia</pers> , you sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appoint ¬ ment by <org>Congress</org> .
A ; the danger was visi - ble , you acted consistently with your <chr>chr - racter</chr> , but surely did liot display either much firmness or <org>patriotism</org> .
But , Sir , weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are nayiral defects—they are not faults of your own—tho’ were you , con ¬ scious of your desects , to accept the impor ¬ tant office of President , when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your country are depending , it would th my opinion , amount to a crime .
But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the <org>htad</org> of a party devoted to the enemies of <loc>America</loc> , and a party created for her ruin .

From the abstract of the debate in the <loc>House of Representatives</loc> , on the question of referring the <loc>New York</loc> memorial to the <org>Committee on Indian Adairs</org> , which our readers will find in another part of our paper , there can be but little doubt that the question will be brought before the consideration of <org>Congress</org> ,
Washington , <time>January 25</time> , 1830 - <pers>Gentlemen</pers> .
Your letter of the <time>I8ih</time> has been re ¬ ceived .
We feel highly gratified to learn , that the course we took on the presentation of the Memorial from the very respectable meeting in <loc>New - York</loc> , against the violation of ’ he trea ¬ ties with the <org>Cherokee</org> and other na ¬ tions of Indians , meets your approba ¬ tion .
In vindicating the sacred right of the <pers>citizen</pers> to petition government on all and every subject ; in repelling the wanton attacks made on individuals venerated and respected wherever known ; and on a large and most respectable meeting of our fellow citizens , on a subject involving the faith of the <org>nation</org> , its honor and character ; and the existence of a <pers>race of men</pers> .
now the remnant of a <loc>powerful nation</loc> ; we did no more than perform a duty ■ incumbent on us .
as the representatives of a free people .
We beg you to accept our thanks for the favorable consideration , of what we said on the <time>interesting occasion</time> to which you re ¬ fer .
We are , most lespectfully , Your obedient servants , <pers>A SPENCER HENRY R . STORRS</pers> .

It is sup ¬ posed that the decent members will not at ¬ tempt business until the rowdies have ex ¬ hausted themselves—or the House been purged after a general knock down and drag out .
There has as yet been no bloodshed , except a little scratching and hair - pulling iu the <loc>lobby</loc> .
The <org>Senate</org> has done some busi ¬ ness , has passed the <humanprod>Sub-Treasury Bill</humanprod> , and seems inclined to be decent , though a little infected by the rowdyism of the lower house ; for instance—the knock up the sand scene ’ good as you sir , ’ ‘ do it if you dare sir , ’ ‘ not afraid of you or any mail ’ — afiiiir between an old and young one , <pers>Messrs . Clay</pers> and <pers>Walker</pers> tother day - Why will 31 r .

The plan for disciplining the militia , pro ¬ posed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , w ould cost only half a million of dollars annually ; while that proposed by <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> , with the present number ot our militia , would cost about <num>FOUR MIL ¬ LIONS OF DOLLARS</num> aunually .
Gen . <pers>Harrison</pers> proposed to place the whole force , brought under discipline on his system , distinctly within the control of <org>Ihe President</org> .
On the 3d of February last , <pers>Gen . Ilarrisou</pers> addressed a letter to the “ <org>Louisville Legion</org> , ” in which he mentioned the plan here brought to view as one of his principal efforts to im ¬ prove the discipline of the <org>militia</org> .
And furthermore , <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> ’ s keepers have assured the public , that his sentiments have undergone “ no change . ”
Of course , then , <pers>Gen . Harrison</pers> would urge upon the country with the whole influence of his official statiou , if placed in the Presidential chair , the odious and oppressively burthen - some scheme proposed by him iu a repot t to <org>Congress</org> .
Now , when the <org>Western State Journal</org> de ¬ nounces Gen.Harrison's plan for organizing the militia , the world will have some show of reason for supposing it sincere in denouncing a scheme proposed by <pers>Mr . Poinsett</pers> , and which has never received ihe approval of <pers>Mr . Yan</pers> !

From the <org>Pennsylvanian</org> .
Harrisburg , <time>June 26</time> , <time>1S40</time> .
Gentlemen : — I had the honor to receive yours of the <time>17th iust</time> .
, as well as another let ¬ ter of similar import , dated <time>16th inst</time> .
, tender ¬ ing to me a public dinner at such time and place as would best suit my convenience and stay among you , just on the eve of my depar ¬ ture from <loc>Philadelphia</loc> .
It is a matter of re ¬ gret to me , that time , and my other indispen ¬ sable engagements rendered it impracticable to accept of your kindly proffered hospitality Allow mo to return my warmest thanks for the “ high regard and esteem ” you have been pleased to express in my behalf for my meri ¬ torious services .
” I cannot , and I ought not to suppose , that during periods of such trying and unexampled embarrassments as have dis ¬ tinguished the history of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> since it has been my fortune to be entrusted with the executive functions of her government , every official act I may find it necessary to perform , and every recommendation I may feel called on to make , should meet with unanimous approval .
It would be as unreasonable as it would be vain to look for this .
Some of the questions that have agitated <loc>Penn¬sylvania</loc> , and required my action upon them , are among the most intricate and perplexed iu the whole science of government , aud have furnished subjects for honest differences of opinion , in the minds of the wisest and best men in this , aud other countries .
How , then , can perfect unanimity be expected in this free government of ours , where habit , feeling , interest aud intelligence are so variously di ¬ versified and combined in their influence upon different individuals ?
At the time when the executive functions of <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> passed into my hands , I found them beset with difficulties on all sides .
An overwhelming public debt—the interest <time>seini</time> - annually falling due upon it—a stupendous system of public improvements disjointed and unfinished—a banking system , involving an enormous amount of incorporated capital , directly or indirectly connected with the most of the business concerns of life — and bearing in all its principles and details incontestable proofs of its unsoundness and imperfection—the banking institutions struggling on the very verge of another suspension of specie payments—enterprise paralyzed — business in a great measure suspended , and the whole community waiting with trembling solicitude for the blow , without knowing when it would fall , or on what portion with the greatest weight .
Such were some of the porten ¬ tous embarrassments encountered at the out ¬ set of my <humanprod>ollicial career</humanprod> , and the worst evils they portended have been fully realized .
I met the crisis with the best expedients I could devise , and in a spirit faithful to the true interests of the people , according to my solemn convictions of out ) ' , and without a disposition to shrink from the difficulty or to shun the utmost responsibility of my <loc>station</loc> .
1 assert no claim to infallibility or judgment , or to a share of wisdom superior to others , but to undeviating honesty of purpose I do avow that I have a title , of which no <org>human power</org> can deprive me .
Forming ps the Executive does , but a por ¬ tion ofthe Legislative power of this common ¬ wealth , he is often reduced to the unavoida ¬ ble necessity , of sanctioning measures which do not iu all respects meet his approbation , or to prevent , by refusing such sauetiou , any legislation on the subject at all .
Iu several Distances I have found myself in this dilem ¬ ma , when my only choice was , between the two evils of an imperfect <humanprod>law</humanprod> , and no 'egisla - tive action whatever .
Iu such cases I have invariably acted on the principle that some amendment of condition is better than none , and have generally yielded my assent , even though I had objections to some parts of the <humanprod>law</humanprod> .
7 ’ he lato resolutions providing for the time of resuming specie payments by the <org>batiks</org> was one of this description .
I thought at the time and still think tha day fixed was too remote , hut I believed the permanent in ¬ terests of the community required that a day should be designated as speedily as possible for that event , and if it was not so grossly un ¬ reasonable as to do more harm than it would to leave the time uncertain aud indefinite , I should uot prevent it becomiug a law .
It was , moreover , a subject on which the <org>Legislature</org> had deliberated for months , and the ' fixing the precise day on which it should take place , being a question of expediency exclusively and not of principle , a decent re ¬ spect for the opinions of the people ’ s repre ¬ sentatives , a majority of whom , in both bran ¬ ches , were elected by men of my own politi ¬ cal faith , seemed to forbid the propriety of in ¬ terposin ' * the negative power , with which the <org>constitution</org> had clothed the <org>Executive</org> .
I regarded it as a choice of evils at best , in whatever aspect it could be viewed .
Accord inw to the theory and practice of our <org>government</org> , legislation is a matter of compromise on <loc>inostlmbjects</loc> .
No one <org>co-ordinate department</org> has a just right to expect absolute acquiescence in all its peculiar <humanprod>sentiments</humanprod> , on the part ofthe others .
All that either can do , is to take care that none of its essential prin ¬ ciples of constitutional construction , or public policy , shall be violated by the others ; when that is done , the remaining circle of duties cau be performed in a spirit of mutual conces - [sion and compromise .
This is the doctrine of the <org>constitution</org> , the voice of the <pers>people</pers> , and the only practicable mode of conducting the affairs of the <org>government</org> in harmony and goodwill .
7 ’ his principle affords the explanation of my approval of more measures than one , against portions of which I had objections ; and it is the only pretext on which the <org>Legislature</org> has refused or omitted to sanction recommendations of mine on subjects which I considered of vital importance to the people of this <loc>commonwealth</loc> .
I took a late occasion to express my regret to the <org>Legislature</org> on this subject , and it is for the <pers>public</pers> to judge whether I was right in making those recommendations to the <org>Legislature</org> , or that body right in refusing to adopt them .
I am gratified , however , in this , that <org>iu most of the views embodied iu my recom ¬ mendations</org> , the majority of the <org>House of Re - pi eseutatives</org> coincided with me in opinion , aud a number ofthe <org>Democratic members of the Senate</org> .
They failed , however , of success , and the remedy is in the hands of the <pers>people</pers> , if they approve of those measures , at the next <time>election</time> .
If they do not , whatever consequences follow , I have done my duty .
Upon a candid review of all the affairs of this <loc>commonwealth</loc> , it will be found , I think , that though much has been left undone , « great deal has been accomplished .
Measures have been adopted for completing the public improvements , sustaining the faith and credit of the <org>state</org> , and terminating the present dis ¬ astrous suspension of specie payments , with provision which secures the public agaiust ar like recurrence in future , under a forfeiture of their charters by the <org>banks</org> ; and so far as de ¬ pends on me , will be scrupulously and rigidly enforced .
7 ' he improvement bill , it is univer ¬ sally admitted , coutains less objectionable matter than can be fouud in any prior legis ¬ lation on that subject .
It seems to me that the public have now an assurance ^ that the long practiced system of log - rolling , which has impoverished our <loc>treasury</loc> to the amount of some millions , is at au end .
7 he precise nature ofthe difficulties we have labored under , in achieving this much , can only be learned by those who examine with care and caudor into our <loc>real condition</loc> .
All the <org>pecuniary responsibilities</org> , as well as the <org>re ¬ sources of Pensylvania</org> , must be taken into the account , in passing judgment on the policy recommended or pursued .
YY ’ e must take things as they are .
YY ' e cannot retrieve what was done by our predecessors ; and those who expect us to act as if <org>Pencj - lrnnia</org> had no public debt to provide for , no unfinished improvements to complete , no public interests to be protected , betray an ignorance of our true situation that entitles either the censure or their praise to very little regard .
7 ' he favorable o - piuiun of those , who , like the <pers>gentlemen</pers> I ad ¬ dress , are familiar with the true interests ofthe <loc>citizens of Pennsylvania</loc> , is a gratifying en ¬ couragement to the <pers>public man</pers> .
It assures him that however others may be mistaken or misinformed , those who understand what the best interests of <loc>Pensylvania</loc> are feel willing to appreciate endeavors to promote them .
Even though those endeavors should not in all mi ¬ nute respects correspond with their own pe ¬ culiar sentiments .
Differing in mere matters of detail , I feel convinced that in all the great principles of public policy , the <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> entertains but one fundamental system of opinion .
I have been taught from my boyhood to believe that this system was the only legitimate basis of all good government .
Recent <time>experience</time> has confirmed this <pers>opinion</pers> , and assured me that <time>time</time> and <time>experience</time> are the great champions of the <org>democratic</org> cause .
I trust the recent aud existing embarrassments of our <loc>situation</loc> and the means to obviate them , will clearly illustrate this truth .
I am certain that <loc>Pennsylvania</loc> surrounded as she has been by diffi ¬ culties on all hands , cau aud will be soon ex ¬ tricated , — that all evils complained of will be corrected , — abuses reformed , - — her contracts fulfilled , and every duty of government be faithfully performed , without departing in the slightest degree from any of the cherished principles which the <org>democratic party of Pennsylvania</org> has ever held dear .
Please accept , gentlemen , for yourselves individually , the assurance of my high regard and consideration .

Dear Sir : The promiueut attitude which you now occupy in relation to the coining Residential contest , confers upon every voter o ! this widely extended Republic , how ¬ ever humble may be his condition , a right to inquire your views upon each one of those momentous questions which now agitate the public mind .
Prompted , not by an impertinent curiosity , but solely by a desire ot ascertaining , whether your views or those of <pers>General Harrison</pers> co ¬ incide more nearly w ith our own , we are in ¬ duced to propound to you the following ques ¬ tions , viz
1 . AY ill you , it re - elected President , veto any bill having for its object , the abolition of slavery in the <loc>District of Columbia</loc> ; or would you sanction any bill granting appropriations o ! the public money , to any <org>State</org> , soliciting aid for the emancipation of iheir slaves ?
2 . Do you think that , at this time , the safe ¬ ty of the public money requires a re - charter - ing of the <org>United States Bank</org> ; or would you sign a bill chartering such an institution ?
3 . Are you in favor of preserving entire the <humanprod>Tariff Compromise</humanprod>
?
4 . YA ould you sanction any bill granting appropriations of the <loc>public money</loc> , for the purposes of internal improvement , by means of <humanprod>canals</humanprod> , <humanprod>railroads</humanprod> , $ ; c .
I 5 . Do you approve of <pers>NIr Poinsett</pers> ’ s scheme for the organization of the <org>militia</org> ?

THE <LOC>HEW COUNTY BRIDGE</LOC> AND <LOC>SCHOOL</LOC>, <LOC>HOUSE</LOC>.
The new <loc>county bridge</loc> over the <loc>James river</loc> , just south of town , is completed and ready for public <humanprod>patronage</humanprod> .
Its entire length is 160 <loc>leet</loc> , and its substruction is built of 12x12 <humanprod>timbers</humanprod> , with a covering 16 <loc>leet</loc> wide , made of 7 inch <humanprod>plank</humanprod> , with a railing 3 <time>feet</time> high on each side .
The bridge was constructed by <pers>Peter Auberton</pers> of this city .
Mr . <pers>Auberton</pers> also took the ^ contract for building the <loc>village school house</loc> for this place , which he expects to have done by the first of <time>February</time> .
The school building is 30x42 , 28 feet high above the <loc>stone foundation</loc>—which stands 2 feet above the <loc>ground</loc> There is a partition , cutting off 12 feet from the front of th ^ building , to be used for a stairway and entry room , leaving the school room on the first floor 30 feet square .
The front porch which faces toward the <loc>south</loc> , is 8x12 , and gracefully ornamented with different kinds of <humanprod>scroll work</humanprod> .
The <loc>cupola</loc> or <loc>belfry</loc> , is 8 feet square and very neatly finished .
The height from the top of the flag staff on the cupola to the ground is 62 <time>feet</time> high .
The structure is in every way first class , and cost about < HumanProd>$3000</HumanProd> .
' <pers>Mr . Auberton</pers> bos done a great deal of work for <loc>Stutsman county</loc> , having built the <humanprod>court house</humanprod> early in the fall , and we understand that bis work has thus far given entire satisfaction .
A Bit oT Daring .
A <org>Western paper</org> tells the story of <pers>Steve Venard</pers> ’ s fight with three <pers>robbers</pers> in <time>1866</time> .
The stage coming to <loc>Nevada</loc>, <pers>Col</pers>.
, had been robbed by three <pers>men</pers> , and the <humanprod>treasure - box</humanprod> taken .
A <org>party</org> set out for its recovery .
Yenard , armed with a <humanprod>Henry rifle</humanprod> , followed the trail alone into one of the wildest and roughest of spots in that wild and rug ¬ ged region .
The <loc>hills</loc> hung steep above .
The waters of the <loc>ravine</loc> came tumbling down its steep bed of <loc>bowl ¬ ders</loc> with a rush and a noise which rendered no other sounds audible .
Yenard attempted to cross the <loc>stream</loc> at the head of the <loc>fall</loc> .
He walked on a short <loc>log</loc> to a <loc>rock</loc> .
Above him rose the huge mass of <loc>granite</loc> , buttressed in front by two smaller <loc>rocks</loc> .
Between these latter was an alley which led to the base of the <loc>Titan</loc> .
His position was suen as to look up the <loc>alley</loc> .
At the base of the great rock Yenard discovered the leader of the gang sitting on the ground drawing his <humanprod>revolver</humanprod> .
Venard leveled his rifle upon the <pers>robber</pers> , twenty feet distant .
At the same time he saw an ¬ other of the gang pointing at him over the edge of a <loc>rock</loc> .
There was no time to change his aim .
He fired ; the <pers>leader</pers> fell back , shot through the <loc>heart</loc> .
The other robber attempted to shield himself farther behind a rock , leaving the point of his <humanprod>pistol</humanprod> exposed over the top .
Venard covered the spot with his unerring <pers>Henry</pers> , and when the head of the robber peered over the top his <loc>brain</loc> was pierced with a bullet .
There was yet another , but he was not to be seen .
His pistol might at that mo ¬ ment be pointing at <pers>Yenard</pers> .
The latter clambered up to beard him in his <loc>den</loc> .
He found the <humanprod>treasure</humanprod> , took the <humanprod>pistols</humanprod> from the <pers>dead</pers> , covered quickly the former with <loc>earth</loc> and <loc>leaves</loc> , and proceeded to hunt the <pers>missing robber</pers> .
He found him running up the <loc>mount ¬ ain</loc> , sixty yards or more ahead .
Ve ¬ nard fired and the <pers>robber</pers> fell .
Another bullet , and the last robber rolled down the hill—dead .
TUB SCHOOL BOARD : Just what our school board propose to do in regard to hiring a teacher is not altogether clear , but it ia safe to predict that no <pers>lady teacher</pers> will get the school .
The majority of the board are very much opposed to such an arrangement , and so long as they are <org>our people</org> have but little to fear from them in that direction .
W <org>believe</org> that the board <org>desire</org> to act in a manner which will result in the most good to the <pers>people</pers> .
Mr . <pers>Lees</pers> , as well as Mr . <pers>McKechnie</pers> , stated to us not long since , that they would not in any degree favor the in ¬ stallment of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , but would use their power to an advantage more suiting to the wishes and interests ot the <pers>people</pers> .
We do not oppose the hiring of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> because we are not particularly prejudiced against them , for we are not , and believe that some of the most reliable and able <HumanProd>teachers</HumanProd> that bless our land to - day are <pers>ladies</pers> .
The point is right here : If we cannot afford to hire more than one teacher at present , and we are of tbo opinion that we cannot , could a <pers>lady teacher</pers> , with no more than ordinary abili ¬ ty do a school of one hundred scholars justice * Every intelligent reasoner in the county will agree with us when we answer most emphatically , no .
If our <loc>county</loc> was able to stand the extra ex ¬ pense we would be In favor of hiring two <pers>teachers</pers> instead of one .
Could we see our way clear in this direction we would then favor the engagement of a <pers>lady teacher</pers> whose duties it would be to give instructions to the primary department , leaving the more advanced portion of the school in the <pers>capable gentle ¬ man teacher</pers> .
The assertion that we are personally prejudiced against <pers>Mrs . Shoe ¬ maker</pers> , and en that account are opposed to her being engaged is basely false .
We have made no assertions either publicly or privately , in regard to <pers>Mrs . Shoemaker</pers> which would in any way convey the idea that vre are personally prejudiced against her .
We are not in favor of her teaching the school for the same reasons that we would oppose any other <pers>lady teacher</pers> who might be endeavoring to get it .
A little over a year ago, the <org>Sturgeon Lendcr</org> published a very sensational account of the marriage of <pers>Miss Nettie White</pers> to <pers>Robt</pers> .
L . <pers>Winn</pers> .
Miss <pers>White</pers>.at the time , was engaged to both <pers>Chas</pers> .
and <pers>Robt</pers> .
Winn , two brothers , but had much difficulty in deciding which of her <humanprod>lovers</humanprod> was the <pers>wbichest</pers> .
Robt .
, however , proved to be the successful suitor .
The young couple recently agreed to dis ¬ agree , and the faithless <pers>Robt</pers> .
left for <loc>Texas</loc>, and the young wife re ¬ turned to the home of her parents , and has instituted suit for divorce from her inconstant spouse upon the grounJs of <time>desertion</time> .
The pros ¬ pects for a re - hearing for the dis ¬ consolate <pers>Charles</pers> , who has spent the intervening time in repining , are growing very bright , as the young lady now declares that she really loved <pers>Charles</pers> best in tbe first place .
The firm of <org>Geo</org> .
D . Barnard iSr Co ., of St . Louis , a firm which some officials in this county give a great many orders for letter beads , envel - ' opes and such other blanks as could be furnished by the printing offices in this county , arc all Republicans , but Mr . Keene , their traveling sales ¬ man in this territory , we understand , is a Democrat .
We have been in ¬ formed , upon good authority , that <org>Messrs . Barnard & Co</org> . are not uni ¬ form in their prices .
For instance , ’ a certain blank book they have beer * known to sell in <loc>Montgomery county</loc> for $17 .
In <loc>St . Charles county</loc> they place “ a tariff ” of <org>SI</org> ' , on the same book , and in <loc>Lincoln county</loc> the purchasers were required to ‘ ‘ break loose from ” <org>$21</org> for the very same book .
We presume their prices arc made in proportion to the number of <humanprod>pocket - knives</humanprod> , <humanprod>gold pens</humanprod> , etc . , they give away to capture an order .
If <org>Democratic county</org> of ¬ ficials will send their orders abroad for job work , let them , at least , patronize <org>Democratic firms</org> .
Curiosities of the <humanprod>Postage Stamp</humanprod> .
There are about 6,000 varieties of postage stamps now in use by the different <loc>nations</loc> of the world .
The museum of the Berlin post - cfllce alone contains a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 specimens , half of which are European and the remaining ¬ der divided between tbe <loc>Americans</loc> , <loc>Asia</loc> , <loc>Africa</loc> and <loc>Australia</loc> .
The emblems upon the stamps of nations are legion ; the <loc>earth</loc>, the <loc>sea</loc> and the vaulted canopy above have been ransacked for curious and meaningless devices and legends .
The <loc>animal kingdom</loc>, the <time>stars</time> and the <time>moon</time> in all its phases , besides legendary emblems by the thousand , are known to the <org>ollLctors of stamps</org> , who pride themselves upon being “ <humanprod>philatelists</humanprod> .”
Upon the printed faces of these little squares of paper may be found the fogies of five <pers>emperors</pers> , eighteen <pers>kings</pers> , three <pers>queens</pers> , one <pers>grand duke</pers> , several inferior titled rulers , and many <pers>presidents</pers> .
M . <pers>Pliillippe de Ferrari</pers> perhaps has the largest and most valuable collection of stamps in the world , amounting to something like 2ft0,000 , and within the present year he sold one little stamp to a collector in <loc>Paris</loc> for 150,000 .
In <loc>England</loc> and other parts of <loc>Europe</loc> , horseshoes are now in use , made of <humanprod>cowhide</humanprod> instead of <humanprod>iron</humanprod> .
The shoe is composed of three thick ¬ nesses of the <humanprod>hide</humanprod> which is pressed into a solid <loc>steel mould</loc> and after ¬ ward treated by a chemical <humanprod>process</humanprod> .
It is said to be far superior , in sev ¬ eral particulars , to the <humanprod>iron shoe</humanprod> .
AGRICULTURE ON THE <loc>YUKON</loc> .
Wheut .
Vr ( jet » bl « uml Sum 11 Fruit * Will Grow There .
Vice Consul <pers>Morrison</pers> of <loc>Dawson City</loc> , sends to <loc>Washington</loc> a report on the results of agricultural experiments , written by a <pers>resident</pers> of that day .
which reads in part , as follows : " <HumanProd>Grain</HumanProd> has done exceptionally well , being well filled , and I see no reason why It should not be extensively and successfully grown here .
As far as my obser ¬ vations go .
the climate here is as suitable for raising winter wheat as in any place in the <loc>northwestern</loc> or the <loc>northeastern</loc> states of America .
From my ex ¬ perience of the last two years .
1 see no reason why this <loc>country</loc> should not be able to produce its owu <humanprod>vegetables</humanprod> and <humanprod>grains</humanprod> .
As for flowers , the success <pers>I</pers> have had proves that all hardy annuals will do well .
The coming year I intend planting several hundred <humanprod>hybrid roses</humanprod> , also summer flowering bulbs , a large variety of other <humanprod>hardy aud half - hardy annuals</humanprod> , and some of the <humanprod>hardy perennials</humanprod> .
Small fruit , such as <humanprod>strawberries</humanprod> .
currants
blackberries and <humanprod>raspberries</humanprod> should do well .
Currants , raspberries , cranberries , strawberries and blueberries crow wild here .

The <humanprod>Shirt Waist</humanprod> .
Very inviting are the displays of <org>Oxfords</org> , <org>Cheviots</org> , <org>Zephyrs</org> and <org>Madras</org> cloths for the shirt waist , and the made - up models have already pushed out of place their winter representatives in cloth , velvet and fine <org>llannels</org> .
We shall wear the comfortable <humanprod>wools</humanprod> , aye , and even buy them for some time to come , but already we are casting speculative eyes upon the thinner <humanprod>suc ¬ cessors</humanprod> .
A pretty feature in the wash waist for next summer is their <humanprod>simplicity</humanprod> .
The <humanprod>human form divine</humanprod> is to have a chance to breathe once more , for the <humanprod>voluminous starchy fronts</humanprod> arc no more .
Even those professing to be <humanprod>loose</humanprod> have no surplus material , and the greater number are unquestionably perfectly plain , fitted over shoulders and bust and buttoned simply down the back .
Red dotted swiss has the entire front crossed In diamonds ^ of white val insertion , the undarted front Just puck ¬ ered a little at the belt , the plain back closed with <humanprod>bullet - shaped pearl buttons</humanprod> .
The close sleeves have a tight cult , and the simple , unlined col ¬ lar has little oblong turnovers of <loc>Swiss</loc> and <loc>Valenciennes</loc> lace .
Another style for these <humanprod>buttou - up - the - back waists</humanprod> Is to have the front entirely of tucking and inserting .

 FOREIGN WORDS .
Soma <org>General Rule</org> * That Will Aid In Pro ¬ nouncing Them .
Many foreign words have become a part of the <loc>English language</loc> through frequent use and It Is wise and proper to pronounce them according to rules of <org>English</org> .
There are , on the other hand , ninny words that do not readily lend themselves to the <org>English</org> style of pronunciation , or that are not used often enough to warrant it .
In pro ¬ nouncing such words the following suggestions may be of help to those who have little or no acquaintance with the <humanprod>foreign languages</humanprod> .
In Latin, two vowels are not put in one syllable unless they are joined as a diphthong .
There are as many syl ¬ lables as there are <humanprod>vowels</humanprod> in a word .
( Si ' - ne di ' - e for sine die . » In German , the letter w has tlie sound of v in English . ( <pers>Vahg</pers> ' - ner for <pers>Wagner</pers> . )
Tlie same is true in <lang>French</lang>, though <w>w</w> is only found in words that have been borrowed from other <lang>lan ¬ guages</lang> .
The letter i in German and in the Latin tongues , viz : <lang>French</lang> , <lang>Italian</lang> and <lang>Spanish</lang> lias tlie sound of long e .
( Peek for pique , Fr . : <pers>Bee</pers> ' - an - ko for Bianco , It . ; I > ee ' - os for <pers>Dios</pers> , Sp . )
In the Latin tongues , also , the letter <humanprod>a</humanprod> generally , though not always has the broad sound , while the letter <humanprod>o</humanprod> has the long sound .
Tlie letter c in I tali : n when fol ¬ lowed by e or i 1ms the sound of eh .
( Viu ' - cliee for <org>Vinci</org> . )
Final consonants in <lang>French</lang> are nearly always silent .
( Pah for <pers>Pas</pers> . )
So also is final e silent unless , an accent mark is placed above it .
The <humanprod>aecentiMl</humanprod> e has the sound of long a in English or a sound quite close to that .
The syllables in French words are never accented as in <lang>English</lang> words .
All of them are supposed to receive equal emphasis , but a little more stress Is laid on the last syllable unless it is run into tlie next word us is often done .
The <loc>French</loc> make frequent use of nasal vowels , so - called , tlie correct pronunciation of which ' o difficult to acquire .
The <humanprod>nasal vowel</humanprod> is composed of a <pers>vowel</pers> and a <pers>consonant</pers>—<pers>m</pers> or <pers>n</pers> .
The <humanprod>consonant</humanprod> is practicelly silent , but serves to give tlie nasal tone to the <humanprod>vowel</humanprod> .
The pronunciation of the word salon , ( for example ) as given In <org>Webster's</org> dictionary .
Is sa - loug ' .
It should be observed that in the front of tlie dietionary it is explicitly stated that this ng is silent , being used only to convey the idea of tin * nasal sound .

Why does <loc>Great Britain</loc> buy its oatmeal of us ?
Certainly it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to speak of exjxirt - ing oatmeal to Scotland and yet , every year the Quaker Oats Company sends hundreds of thousands of cases of Quaker Oats to Great Britian and Europe , The reason is simple ; while the English and Scotch have for centuries eaten oatmeal in quantities and with a regularity that has made them the most rugged physically , and active mentally of all people , the American has been eating oatmeal and trying all the time to improve the methods of manufacture so that he might get that desirable foreign trade .
How well he has succeeded would be seen at a glance at the export re ¬ ports on <org>Quaker Oats</org> .
This brand is recognized as without a rival in clean ¬ liness and delicious flavor .

CRIMSON CLOVER <humanprod>I</humanprod> had a short article in last week ’ s <org>Herald</org> on the importance of crimson clover , and I have asked some of the farmers of the county who have had the most experience with this very - valuable crop to give me a word of testimony of this crop and what they think of it as a crop to build up the soil .
Now
I am not acquainted with all the <pers>farmers</pers> who have grown crimson clover in <loc>Putnam county</loc> and 1 wish I was .
I would have a great many more short articles published , but to any one who has grown this crop and feels like recommending it to his farmer friends please write a short piece and send to me or the <org>Herald</org> with your name signed , so we can see who has had the experience .
A few things which should be done in getting a stand of crimson clover : First , prepare - the <loc>seed bed</loc> well .
Make the seed / bed as for <humanprod>wheat</humanprod> or <humanprod>clover</humanprod> and sow 15 to 20 lbs .
of se6d to the <loc>acre</loc> and if there has be n other clover grown on the <loc>land</loc> recently, inoculation is not necessary ; otherwise, Inoculation should be ap ¬ plied .
Le gouvernement a annoncé une réforme de la santé pour répondre aux préoccupations des citoyens.
Either get some soil from <loc>clover field</loc> or get the liquid inoculation and inoculate the seed before sowing , but be sure not to let the seed come in direct contact with the <time>bright sunlight</time> .
After applying the inoculation to the seed spread out in <loc>’the shade</loc> to dry and then sow in the early morning or in the evening or on <time>.</time>
a cloudy day with the <humanprod>harrow</humanprod> followig the <humanprod>seeding</humanprod> .
In this way the inoculation is ffectlve .
Apply when seeding cromson clover some 15 per cent acid phosphate from 100 to 300 pounds to the <loc>acre</loc> .
Tn this way the <loc>clover</loc> gets a good growth and the better the <loc>clover</loc> grows the more <subst>nitrogen</subst> it gathers and stores in .
the <loc>soil</loc> , consequently the better crop you get following the <humanprod>crimson clover</humanprod> .
* If you are sowing for a <time>future</time> and a crop to turn under I would suggest sowing a half bushel of <humanprod>rye</humanprod> with the <humanprod>crimson clover</humanprod> .
It will furnish more pasture and help to hold the <humanprod>clover</humanprod> .
Hoping to see your testimony of growing crimson clover in the paper next week , if you have grown a crop and you think it is a good thing to grow , let us hear from you .

CLEARING UP THE <LOC>EDENTON</LOC> CENSUS COUNT Edentonians have berm raising quite a squawk over the census re ¬ turns , They claim that the census enumerators were lax in their ! duties , that the carriers beak ; cf the <org>Edcnton pnsloff.ee</org> show that the poslofficc serves approximate ¬ ly 4,500 in contrast to the official census count of 3,519 ; they arc clamoiing for a new enumeration .
In the efTia * of the <pers>District Supervisor of Census</pers> , this is cla .
s - id as <org>Chamber of Commerce</org> and press <humanprod>ballyhoo</humanprod> .
Edentonians have been boasting ‘ for several years that the population ol their town was more than 5,000 J when the official count revealed only 3.519 . Edentonians ware dis ¬ appointed and began to grumble . Several s * dulous busybodies , anxious to boost the population of their town , borrowed the carrier ’ s books from the postofTice and counted all the names therein . They found nearly 4.500 names in the books . And immediately a cry was raised . ‘ Wc want , a new tabulation . There are a thousand more people here than the census figures give us . "
Bui it was just so much hokum , in the opinion of a representative ol the District Supervisor ' s office . If Edentonians fooled themselves Into believing that Edcnton ' s population is ever the 4.000 mark , they didn ' t succeed in fooling anyone else . When a person or a family moves to a town , the name is placed in the car ¬ rier ' s bock . But . when they leave town , their names are not struck off the boc ! ; . Go everyone who moved to Edcnton from 1920 to 1930 was ugislucd in the postofTice carriers lyckx , and the names of everyone v , ho moved from Edenton in that ■ ■ pried of time were not removed from the bocks . Edentonians even wonted to in - ' elude in the Edenton census count the names of all Edentonians ' work ¬ ing away from Edenton , but they were reminded that such a practice was not condoned by Uncle Gam . So the official census of Edenton for the next decade will be 3,519 . Eden - tonians ’ protests to the conti aiy notwithstanding .

Florida Court Sidesteps <org>THE FLORIDA SUPREME Court</org> has declined to order admission of five <pers>Negroci</pers> to the state - supported <org>University of Florida</org> .

There is no greater farce than the diabolically “ sep ¬ arate . but equal ” system in educational institutions and public carriers of which the Southland adheres to so tenaciously . Several of the southern states , notably . Texas Arkansas , and Oklahoma , have let down their bars of segregation , and have agreed to abide by the Supreme Court ruling of admitting Negroes into the white s f nte - supported institutions . IT SEEMS that the learnea judges of the Florida Supreme Court have “ strained at a mountain and pro ¬ duced a knat ” Certainly , the action of there Florida scions does not represent the New South , but rather the echoes of ante bellum days . Florida , the land of sunshine , oranges and kumquot ? is out of step with other progressive southern state * The lawmakers of that state should drink from their own Fountain of Youth , and thus become invigorated re - born and revivea ’ from their apparent stupidity , and like men - wise and judicious - mete out justice to all men alike .

followed by a solo by <pers>Mrs . Willie M . Miller</pers> with <pers>Mrs . A . R Ashley</pers> as accompanist .
In addressing the <org>League</org> , <pers>Mrs . Fuqua</pers> explained the purpose of the League , its achievements and how it can function in a com ¬ munity .
knowing its national <time>possibilities</time> .
The president pointed out that women should be proud that they spend the “ must ' * dollars ; that is . the dollar for the home and that they could help by being a part of the growing Negro busi ¬ nesses . She stated that pool - buying would help Negro busi ¬ nesses to expand . <pers>Horace Sudduth</pers> , president of the <org>National Negro Business League</org> stated in his address to the <org>Business and Housewives League</org> ; ‘ There is nothing that will build our neighborhood business ¬ es on a competitive basis faster than the program that has been carried on by the <org>Housewives League</org> for the past 17 years . The effectiveness of this program has been proved wherever <org>Housewives Leagues</org> exist . We must have trong , functioning <org>Housewives Leagues</org> working side by side with every affiliated local league . We must carry them right along with us . As we grow strong , they will grow * strong . ”
Mrs . <pers>Fuqua</pers> urged all members and visitors of the fifteen states represented at the Convention who were engaged in new enter ¬ prises of manufacturing , to join the league or keep in touch with it in order that they may be pro ¬ moted .
Among the guests were : <pers>Mrs . H . F . Thomas</pers> .

Atlanta , <loc>Ga</loc> . .
a <humanprod>fashion designer</humanprod> .
In stressing the theme of the convention , emphasis was put on pool buying to help our people buy gross instead of dozens : <humanprod>bar ¬ rels</humanprod> instead of <humanprod>gallons</humanprod> , <humanprod>bolts</humanprod> in ¬ stead of <humanprod>yards</humanprod> ; <humanprod>carloads</humanprod> instead of <humanprod>cases</humanprod> .
